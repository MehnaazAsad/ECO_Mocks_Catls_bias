Mock Catalogues
===================

We construct a set of synthethic (mock) catalogues that have the same 
geometries as the **Environmental COntext** (ECO), **RESOLVE-A**, and 
**RESOLVE-B** galaxy surveys.

RESOLVE is a volume-limited census of stellar, gas, and dynamical mass as 
well as star formation and merging within >50,000 cubic Mpc of the nearby 
cosmic web, reaching down to the dwarf galaxy regime and up to structures 
on tens of Mpc scales such as filaments, walls, and voids.

The Environmental COntext (ECO) catalog around RESOLVE is a much larger, purely archival data set with pipelines and methods matched to RESOLVE, enabling statistically robust analyses of environmental trends and calibration of cosmic variance.
