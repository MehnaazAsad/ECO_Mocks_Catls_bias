abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {We reanalyze the galaxy-mass correlation function measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to obtain host dark matter halo masses at galaxy and galaxy group scales. We extend the data to galaxy clusters in the 2MASS catalog and study the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass. While the central galaxy luminosity scales as {\~{}}M{\^{}}{\{}0.7-0.8{\}} at low masses, the relation flattens to {\~{}}M{\^{}}{\{}{\textless}0.3{\}} above {\~{}}4x10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} M{\_}sun. The total luminosity of galaxies in the halo, however, continues to grow as a power-law {\~{}}M{\^{}}{\{}0.8-0.9{\}}. Starting from the hypothesis that the central galaxies grow by merging ("galactic cannibalism"), we develop a simple model for the evolution of their luminosities as a consequence of the accretion of satellite galaxies. The luminosity-mass relation flattens when the time scale on which dynamical friction induces orbital decay in the satellite galaxies exceeds the age of the dark matter halo. Then, the growth of the central galaxy is suppressed as it can cannibalize only the rare, massive satellite galaxies. The model takes the dependence of the total luminosity of galaxies in a halo on its mass and the global galaxy luminosity function as input, and reproduces the observed central galaxy luminosity-mass relation over three decades in halo mass, (10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}) M{\_}sun.  The success of the model suggests that gas cooling and subsequent star formation did not play an important role in the final assembly of central galaxies from sub-L{\_}star precursors.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the redshift-space luminosity-weighted or `marked' correlation function in the SDSS. These are compared with a model in which the luminosity function and luminosity dependence of clustering are the same as that observed, and in which the form of the luminosity-weighted correlation function is entirely a consequence of the fact that massive halos populate dense regions. We do this by using mock catalogs which are constrained to reproduce the observed luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of clustering, as well as by using the language of the redshift-space halo-model. These analyses show that marked correlations may show a signal on large scales even if there are no large-scale physical effects--the statistical correlation between halos and their environment will produce a measureable signal. Our model is in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the halo mass function in dense regions is top-heavy; the correlation between halo mass and large scale environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy properties and environment; and the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halo is different from (in general, brighter than) that of the other objects in the halo. Thus our measurement provides strong evidence for the accuracy of these three standard assumptions of galaxy formation models. These assumptions also form the basis of current halo-model based interpretations of galaxy clustering.},

abstract = {The stellar-dark halo mass relation of galaxies at different redshifts, M s(M h, z), encloses relevant features concerning their physical processes and evolution. This sequence of relations, defined in the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 4, together with average $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) halo mass aggregation histories (MAHs), is used here for inferring average galaxian hybrid evolutionary tracks (GHETs), where hybrid remarks on the combination of observational (M s) and theoretical (M h) ingredients. As a result of our approach, a unified picture of stellar and halo mass buildup, population migration, and downsizing of galaxies as a function of mass is presented. The inferred average M s growth histories (GHETs) of the highest and lowest mass galaxies are definitively quite different from the average MAHs, M h(z), of the corresponding dark halos. Depending on how a given M h(z) compares with the mass at which the M s-to-M h ratio curve peaks at the epoch z, M hp(z), two evolutionary phases are evidenced: (1) galaxies in an active regime of M s growth when M h {\textless} M hp and (2) galaxies in a quiescent or passive regime when M h{\textgreater}M hp. The typical M s at which galaxies transit from the active (star-forming) to the quiescent regime, M tran, increases with z, log(M tran/M ☉) 10.30 + 0.55z, making evident a population downsizing phenomenon. This result agrees with independent observational determinations based on the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function decomposition into blue and red galaxy populations. The specific star formation rate (SSFR) predicted from the derivative of the GHET is consistent with direct measures of the SSFR for galaxies at different redshifts, though both sets of observational inferences are independent. The average GHETs of galaxies smaller than M tran at z = 0 (M s 1010.3 M ☉, M h 1011.8 M ☉) did not reach the quiescent regime, and for them, the lower the mass, the faster the later M s growth rate (downsizing in SSFR). The GHETs allow us to predict the transition rate in the number density of active to passive population; the predicted values agree with direct estimates of the growth rate in the number density for the (massive) red population up to z {\~{}} 1. We show that $\Lambda$CDM-based models of disk galaxy evolution, including feedback-driven outflows, are able to reproduce the low-mass side of the M s-M h relation at z {\~{}} 0, but at higher z strongly disagree with the GHETs: models do not reproduce the strong downsizing in SSFR and the high SSFR of low-mass galaxies.},

abstract = {We investigate how the way galaxies acquire their gas across cosmic time in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations is modified by a comprehensive physical model for baryonic feedback processes. To do so, we compare two simulations - with and without feedback - both evolved with the moving mesh code AREPO. The feedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation project, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback from supermassive black holes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material contributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the intergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as well as the net, inflow of this `smooth mode' gas at all redshifts, regardless of the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the temperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z = 2. However, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir decreases substantially, from more than 80 per cent to less than 50 per cent, while the rates of both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this boundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total accretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of 2 across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold temperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z {\textless} 1. (d) The amount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy - the `halo transit time' - increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of {\~{}}=2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible implications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.},

abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude-limited redshift surveys. Since, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter halos, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional Friends-of-Friends group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter halos to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM `concordance' cosmology we find a clear discrepancy between the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 \backslashsimeq 0.7{\$}, compared to the `concordance' value of 0.9.},

abstract = {We study satellite galaxy abundances by counting photometric galaxies from the Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS/DR8) around isolated bright primary galaxies from SDSS/DR7. We present results as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass and colour of the satellites, and of the stellar mass and colour of the primaries. For massive primaries (log M★/M⊙ {\textgreater} 11.1) the luminosity and stellar mass functions of satellites with log M★/M⊙ {\textgreater} 8 are similar in shape to those of field galaxies, but for lower mass primaries they are significantly steeper, even accounting for exclusion effects due to the isolation criteria. The steepening is particularly marked for the stellar mass function. Satellite abundance increases strongly with primary stellar mass, approximately in proportion to expected dark halo mass. For log M★/M⊙ {\textgreater} 10.8, red primaries have more satellites than blue ones of the same stellar mass. The effect exceeds a factor of 2 at log M★/M⊙ ∼ 11.2. Satellite galaxies are systematically redder than field galaxies of the same stellar mass, except around primaries with log M★/M⊙ {\textless} 10.8, where their colours are similar or even bluer. Satellites are also systematically redder around more massive primaries. At fixed primary mass, they are redder around red primaries. We select similarly isolated galaxies from mock catalogues based on the galaxy formation simulations of Guo et al. and analyse them in parallel with the SDSS data. The simulation reproduces all the above trends qualitatively, except for the steepening of the satellite luminosity and stellar mass functions with decreasing primary mass. Model satellites, however, are systematically redder than in the SDSS, particularly at low mass and around low-mass primaries. Simulated haloes of a given mass have satellite abundances that are independent of central galaxy colour, but red centrals tend to have lower stellar masses, reflecting earlier quenching of star formation by feedback. This explains the correlation between satellite abundance and primary colour in the simulation. The correlation between satellite colour and primary colour arises because red centrals live in haloes which are more massive, older and more gas rich, so that satellite quenching is more efficient.},

abstract = {Correlations between the star formation rates (SFRs) of nearby galaxies (so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations up to 4 Mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. We investigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dMvir/dt) of nearby halos as a potential physical origin for this effect. We find that pairs of host halos "know about" each others' assembly histories even when their present-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either halo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the halos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt. Instead, halo pairs at these distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, which regulates dMvir/dt for both halos. Larger halos are less affected by external forces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformity signal. SDSS measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitatively similar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies with distance. Based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy SFR are correlated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scale galactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levels by z {\textgreater} 1. These predictions are testable with current surveys to z {\~{}} 1; confirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter halo accretion rate and central galaxy SFR.},

abstract = {We use the conditional luminosity function (CLF) and data from the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) to constrain the average relation between light and mass in a Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology with m = 0.23 and $\sigma$ 8 = 0.74 (hereafter WMAP3 cosmology). Reproducing the observed luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function results in average mass-to-light ratios that are ∼35 per cent lower than those in a CDM cosmology with m = 0.3 and $\sigma$ 8 = 0.9 (hereafter WMAP1 cosmology). This removes an important problem with previous halo occupation models which had a tendency to predict cluster mass-to-light ratios that were too high. For the WMAP3 cosmology, our model yields average mass-to-light ratios, central galaxy luminosities, halo occupation numbers, satellite fractions and luminosity-gap statistics, that are all in excellent agreement with those obtained from a 2dFGRS group catalogue and from other independent studies. We also use our CLF model to compute the probability distribution P(M | L cen), that a central galaxy of luminosity L cen resides in a halo of mass M. We find this distribution to be much broader than what is typically assumed in halo occupation distribution models, which has important implications for the interpretation of satellite kinematics and galaxy–galaxy lensing data. Finally, reproducing the luminosity dependence of the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersions in the 2dFGRS requires relatively low mass-to-light ratios for clusters and a satellite fraction that decreases strongly with increasing luminosity. This is only marginally consistent with the constraints obtained from the luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function. We argue that a cosmology with parameters between those of the WMAP1 and WMAP3 cosmologies is likely to yield results with a higher level of consistency.},

abstract = {We describe an automated method, the cut-and-enhance (CE) method, for detecting clusters of galaxies in multicolor optical imaging surveys. This method uses simple color cuts, combined with a density enhancement algorithm, to up-weight pairs of galaxies that are close in both angular separation and color. The method is semiparametric, since it uses minimal assumptions about cluster properties in order to minimize possible biases. No assumptions are made about the shape of clusters, their radial profile, or their luminosity function. The method is successful in finding systems ranging from poor to rich clusters of galaxies, of both regular and irregular shape. We determine the selection function of the CE method via extensive Monte Carlo simulations that use both the real, observed background of galaxies and a randomized background of galaxies. We use position-shuffled and color-shuffled data to perform false-positive tests. We have also visually checked all the clusters detected by the CE method. We apply the CE method to the 350 deg2 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data and construct an SDSS CE galaxy cluster catalog with an estimated redshift and richness for each cluster. The CE method is compared with other cluster selection methods used on SDSS data such as the matched filter, ``maxBCG,'' and Voronoi tessellation techniques. The CE method can be adopted for cluster selection in any multicolor imaging survey.},

abstract = {Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we examine the quenching of satellite galaxies around isolated Milky Way-like hosts in the local Universe. We find that the efficiency of satellite quenching around isolated galaxies is low and roughly constant over two orders of magnitude in satellite stellar mass ({\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$} = {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}8.5{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} \backslash, M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), with only {\$}\backslashsim{\~{}}20\backslash{\%}{\$} of systems quenched as a result of environmental processes. While largely independent of satellite stellar mass, satellite quenching does exhibit clear dependence on the properties of the host. We show that satellites of passive hosts are substantially more likely to be quenched than those of star-forming hosts, and we present evidence that more massive halos quench their satellites more efficiently. These results extend trends seen previously in more massive host halos and for higher satellite masses. Taken together, it appears that galaxies with stellar masses larger than about {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} are uniformly resistant to environmental quenching, with the relative harshness of the host environment likely serving as the primary driver of satellite quenching. At lower stellar masses ({\$}{\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), however, observations of the Local Group suggest that the vast majority of satellite galaxies are quenched, potentially pointing towards a characteristic satellite mass scale below which quenching efficiency increases dramatically.},

abstract = {The two-point correlation function has been the standard statistic for quantifying how galaxies are clustered. The statistic uses the positions of galaxies, but not their properties. Clustering as a function of galaxy property, be it type, luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysing a subset of the full population, the galaxies in the subset chosen because they have a similar range of properties. We explore an alternative technique---marked correlations---in which one weights galaxies by some property or `mark' when measuring clustering statistics. Marked correlations are particularly well-suited to quantifying how the properties of galaxies correlate with their environment. Therefore, measurements of marked statistics, with luminosity, stellar mass, color, star-formation rate, etc. as the mark, permit sensitive tests of galaxy formation models. We make measurements of such marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models to illustrate their utility. These measurements show that close pairs of galaxies are expected to be red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star formation rates. We also show that the simplest unbiased estimator of the particular marked statistic we use extensively is very simple to measure---it does not require construction of a random catalog---and provide an estimate of its variance. Large wide-field surveys of the sky are revolutionizing our view of galaxies and how they evolve. Our results indicate that application of marked statistics to this high quantity of high-quality data will provide a wealth of information about galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-{\AA} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index H$\delta$A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +/-40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-{\AA} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses {\~{}}5× 1010Msolar, half-light radii {\~{}}3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities {\~{}}109 Msolar kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

Making use of isolation and satellite criteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolated galaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. Separating the red and blue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, we investigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how the red fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host mass and the projected distance from their host. Comparing the red fraction of satellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii, we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass. The satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample for hosts with 11.0 {\textless} log M{\_}* {\textless} 11.5, while the red fractions show no difference for hosts with 10.0 {\textless} log M{\_}* {\textless} 10.5. For the satellites of more massive hosts the red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance. Our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of star formation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.},

abstract = {How does the clustering of galaxies depend on their inner properties like morphological type and luminosity? We address this question in the mathematical framework of marked point processes and clarify the notion of luminosity and morphological segregation. A number of test quantities such as conditional mark-weighted two-point correlation functions are introduced. These descriptors allow for a scale-dependent analysis of luminosity and morphology segregation. Moreover, they break the degeneracy between an inhomogeneous fractal point set and actual present luminosity segregation. Using the Southern Sky Redshift Survey{\~{}}2 (da Costa et al. 1998, SSRS2) we find both luminosity and morphological segregation at a high level of significance, confirming claims by previous works using these data (Benoist et al. 1996, Willmer et al. 1998). Specifically, the average luminosity and the fluctuations in the luminosity of pairs of galaxies are enhanced out to separations of 15Mpc/h. On scales smaller than 3Mpc/h the luminosities on galaxy pairs show a tight correlation. A comparison with the random-field model indicates that galaxy luminosities depend on the spatial distribution and galaxy-galaxy interactions. Early-type galaxies are also more strongly correlated, indicating morphological segregation. The galaxies in the PSCz catalog (Saunders et al. 2000) do not show significant luminosity segregation. This again illustrates that mainly early-type galaxies contribute to luminosity segregation. However, based on several independent investigations we show that the observed luminosity segregation can not be explained by the morphology-density relation alone.},

abstract = {Merger trees follow the growth and merger of dark-matter haloes over cosmic history. As well as giving important insights into the growth of cosmic structure in their own right, they provide an essential backbone to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. This paper is the first in a series to arise from the SUSSING MERGER TREES Workshop in which ten different tree-building algorithms were applied to the same set of halo catalogues and their results compared. Although many of these codes were similar in nature, all algorithms produced distinct results. Our main conclusions are that a useful merger-tree code should possess the following features: (i) the use of particle IDs to match haloes between snapshots; (ii) the ability to skip at least one, and preferably more, snapshots in order to recover subhaloes that are temporarily lost during merging; (iii) the ability to cope with (and ideally smooth out) large, temporary flucuations in halo mass. Finally, to enable different groups to communicate effectively, we defined a common terminology that we used when discussing merger trees and we encourage others to adopt the same language. We also specified a minimal output format to record the results.},

We present the new algorithm that we have developed (ZADE) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically by modifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using the spectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. We present a number of tests on mock catalogs used to justify this approach. The ZADE algorithm allows us to probe a broader range of galaxy environments and reduce the Poisson noise in the density field. The reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zCOSMOS galaxies consists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending up to z {\~{}} 1. Some of these structures are very large, spanning the {\~{}}50 h -1 Mpc transverse direction of the COSMOS field and extending up to $\Delta$z {\~{}} 0.05 in redshift. We present the three-dimensional overdensity maps and compare the reconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialized groups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in X-rays. The distribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by these virialized structures. A comparison of the large-scale structures in the zCOSMOS data and in the mock catalogs reveals an excellent agreement between the fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a given overdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1, although in the data these overdense regions are in generally larger contiguous structures.

abstract = {We use seven high-resolution N-body simulations to study the correlations among different halo properties (assembly time, spin, shape and substructure), and how these halo properties are correlated with the large-scale environment in which haloes reside. The large-scale tidal field estimated from haloes above a mass threshold is used as our primary quantity to characterize the large-scale environment, while other parameters, such as the local overdensity and the morphology of large-scale structure, are used for comparison. For haloes at a fixed mass, all the halo properties depend significantly on environment, particularly the tidal field. The environmental dependence of halo assembly time is primarily driven by local tidal field. The mass of the unbound fraction in substructure is boosted in strong tidal force region, while the bound fraction is suppressed. Haloes have a tendency to spin faster in a stronger tidal field and the trend is stronger for more massive haloes. The spin vectors show significant alignment with the intermediate axis of the tidal field, as expected from the tidal torque theory. Both the major and minor axes of haloes are strongly aligned with the corresponding principal axes of the tidal field. In general, a halo that can accrete more material after the formation of its main halo on average is younger, more elongated, spins faster and contains a larger amount of substructure. Higher-density environments not only provide more material for haloes to accrete, but also are places of stronger tidal fields that tend to suppress halo accretion. The environmental dependencies are the results of these two competing effects. The tidal field based on haloes can be estimated from observation, and we discuss the implications of our results for the environmental dependence of galaxy properties.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing in the context of halo models with CDM motivated dark matter profiles. The model enables us to separate between the central galactic and noncentral group/cluster contributions. We apply the model to the recent SDSS measurements with known redshifts and luminosities of the lenses. This allows one to accurately model the mass distribution of a local galaxy population around and above {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}. We find that virial mass of L* galaxy is M*=(5-10)x10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}M{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}}, depending on the color of the galaxy. This value varies significantly with galaxy morphology with M* for late types being a factor of 10 lower in u', 7 in g' and a factor of 2.5-3 lower in r', i' and z' relative to early types. Fraction of noncentral galaxies in groups and clusters is estimated to be below 10{\%} for late types and around 30{\%} for early types. Using the luminosity dependence of the signal we find that for early types the virial halo mass M scales with luminosity as M $\backslash$propto L{\^{}}1.4 in red bands above L*. This shows that the virial mass to light ratio is increasing with luminosity for galaxies above L*, as predicted by theoretical models. The virial mass to light ratio in i' band is 17(45)hM{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}}/L{\_}{\{}$\backslash$sun{\}} at L* for late (early) types. Combining this result with cosmological baryon fraction one finds that 0.7(0.25)h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}$\backslash$Upsilon{\_}i$\backslash$Omega{\_}m/12$\backslash$Omega{\_}b of baryons within the virial radius are converted to stars at L*, where $\backslash$Upsilon{\_}i is the stellar mass to light ratio in i' band. This indicates that both for early and late type galaxies around L* a significant fraction of all the baryons in the halo is transformed into stars.},

Using the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS) we aim to jointly estimate the key parameters that describe the galaxy density field and its spatial correlations in redshift space. Methods. We use the Bayesian formalism to jointly reconstruct the redshift-space galaxy density field, power spectrum, galaxy bias and galaxy luminosity function given the observations and survey selection function. The high-dimensional posterior distribution is explored using the Wiener filter within a Gibbs sampler. We validate the analysis using simulated catalogues and apply it to VIPERS data taking into consideration the inhomogeneous selection function. Results. We present joint constraints on the anisotropic power spectrum as well as the bias and number density of red and blue galaxy classes in luminosity and redshift bins as well as the measurement covariances of these quantities. We find that the inferred galaxy bias and number density parameters are strongly correlated although these are only weakly correlated with the galaxy power spectrum. The power spectrum and redshift-space distortion parameters are in agreement with previous VIPERS results with the value of the growth rate {\$}f\backslashsigma{\_}8 = 0.38{\$} with 18{\%} uncertainty at redshift 0.7.},

abstract = {Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies -- relatively poor groups of galaxies in which the typical separations between members is of the order of a galaxy diameter -- offer an exceptional laboratory for the study of dense galaxian environments with short ({\textless}1Gyr) dynamical time-scales. In this paper, we present an objectively defined catalog of CGs in 153 sq deg of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early Data Release (SDSS EDR). To identify CGs, we applied a modified version of Hickson's (1982) criteria aimed at finding the highest density CGs and thus reducing the number of chance alignments. Our catalog contains 175 CGs down to a limiting galaxy magnitude of r* = 21. The resulting catalog has a median depth of approximately z = 0.13, substantially deeper than previous CG catalogs. Since the SDSS will eventually image up to one quarter of the celestial sphere, we expect our final catalog, based upon the completed SDSS, will contain on the order of 5,000 - 10,000 CGs. This catalog will be useful for conducting studies of the general characteristics of CGs, their environments, and their component galaxies.},

In addition to numerous checks of the matched filter algorithm, we present results on the halo multiplicity function and the cluster number function. For a subset of our identified clusters we have information on X-ray temperatures and luminosities that we cross-correlate with optical richness and galaxy velocity dispersions. With all quantities normalized by the spherical radius corresponding to a mass overdensity of $\Delta$M = 200 or the equivalent galaxy number overdensity of $\Delta$N = 200$\Omega$ 666, we find that the number of L {\textgreater} L* galaxies in a cluster of mass M200 is log N*666 = (1.44 ± 0.17) + (1.10 ± 0.09) log(M200h/1015 M☉), where the uncertainties are dominated by the scatter created by three choices for relating the observed quantities to the cluster mass. The region inside the virial radius has a K-band cluster mass-to-light ratio of (M/L)K = (116 ± 46)h, which is essentially independent of cluster mass. Integrating over all clusters more massive than M200 = 1014 h-1 M☉, the virialized regions of clusters contain 7{\%} of the local stellar luminosity, quite comparable to the mass fraction in such objects in currently popular $\Lambda$CDM models.},

@article{Tinker2011,
abstract = {The properties of dark matter halos, including mass growth, correlate with larger scale environment at fixed mass, an effect known as assembly bias. However, whether this environmental dependence manifests itself in galaxy properties remains unclear. We apply a group-finding algorithm to DR7 of the SDSS to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy and to decompose galaxies into those that exist at the centers of distinct halos and those that orbit as satellites within larger halos. Using the 4000-A break as a measure of star formation history, we examine the correlation between the quenched fraction of galaxies, f{\_}q, and large-scale environment, rho. At all galaxy magnitudes, there is a positive, monotonic relationship between f{\_}q and rho. We use the group catalog to decompose this correlation into the contribution from central and satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass. Because satellites are more likely to be quenched than central galaxies, the observed f{\_}q-rho correlation is primarily due to variations of the halo mass function with environment, which causes a larger fraction of satellite galaxies at high rho. For low-mass central galaxies (Mgal {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}10.0 Msol/h{\^{}}2), there is no correlation between f{\_}q and rho. These results are inconsistent with the strong assembly bias of dark matter halos seen in this mass regime if recent galaxy growth at all correlates with recent halo growth, as we demonstrate through a high resolution N-body simulation. We also find that the mean stellar age of quenched central galaxies is independent of rho at fixed Mgal, while the formation times of low mass halos vary significantly. We conclude that the processes that halt the star formation of low mass central galaxies are not correlated to the formation histories of their host halos, and old galaxies do not reside preferentially in old halos.

abstract = {We present a new model to describe the galaxy–dark matter connection across cosmic time, which unlike the popular subhalo abundance-matching technique is self-consistent in that it takes account of the facts that (1) subhalos are accreted at different times and (2) the properties of satellite galaxies may evolve after accretion. Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions (SMFs) out to z ∼ 4, the conditional SMF at z ∼ 0.1 obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy group catalogs, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at z ∼ 0.1 as a function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from z ∼ 4 to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-z galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (1) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time. (2) At low-z, the stellar mass of central galaxies increases with halo mass as M 0.3 and M 4.0 at the massive and low-mass ends, respectively. The ratio M * ,c /M reveals a maximum of ∼0.03 at a halo mass M ∼ 10 11.8 h −1 M , much lower than the universal baryon fraction (∼0.17). At higher redshifts the maximum in M * ,c /M remains close to ∼0.03, but shifts to higher halo mass. (3) The inferred timescale for the disruption of satellite galaxies is about the same as the dynamical friction timescale of their subhalos. (4) The stellar mass assembly history of central galaxies is completely decoupled from the assembly history of its host halo; the ratio M * ,c /M initially increases rapidly with time until the halo mass reaches ∼10 12 h −1 M , at which point M * ,c /M ∼ 0.03. Once M 10 12 h −1 M , there is little growth in M * ,c , causing the ratio M * ,c /M to decline. In Milky Way (MW)-sized halos more than half of the central stellar mass is assembled at z 0.5. (5) In low-mass halos, the accretion of satellite galaxies contributes little to the formation of their central galaxies, indicating that most of their stars must have formed in situ. In massive halos more than half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy has to be formed in situ, and the accretion of satellites can only become significant at z 2. (6) The total mass in halo stars is more than twice that of the central galaxy in massive halos, but less than 10{\%} of M * ,c in MW-sized halos. (7) The 2PCFs of galaxies on small scales hold important information regarding the evolution of satellite galaxies, which at high-z is predicted to be much steeper than at low-z, especially for more massive galaxies. We discuss various implications of our findings regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.},

abstract = {The statistical strength of galaxy redshift surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have ushered us into the era of precision measurements of galaxy clustering. We are now fitting physical models to measured clustering statistics. Galaxy clustering is thus in a position to directly constrain cosmological and galaxy formation theories. This paradigm shift from qualitative to quantitative demands that we understand the statistical and systematic errors in our measurements. Moreover, we must quantify the theoretical uncertainties in our models, which are no longer clearly sub-dominant to observational errors.  We address this emerging need with the LasDamas project (LArge Suite of DArk MAtter Simulations) by producing an unprecedented number of independent and realistic mock galaxy catalogs. To date, we have run over 100 independent N-body realizations using a fixed cosmology and initialized using 2nd order Lagrangian perturbation theory. We populate overdensities of dark matter using the halo occupation distribution framework, designed to match both small and large scale clustering of the observed SDSS data. A series of mock galaxy catalogs matching the geometry of the final SDSS release (DR7) are created over a wide luminosity range to correspond to Main and LRG volume-limited samples. We include important observational effects, such as redshift distortions and fiber collisions. These galaxy mocks are publicly available.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that is, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest halo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter potential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption made in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, {\$}{\{}\backslashcal R{\}}{\$} and {\$}{\{}\backslashcal S{\}}{\$}, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members. By comparing the cumulative distributions of {\$}|{\{}\backslashcal R{\}}|{\$} and {\$}|{\{}\backslashcal S{\}}|{\$} to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the null-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a non-zero fraction {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BNC{\}}(M){\$} of all haloes of mass {\$}M{\$} the BHG is not the central galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BNC{\}}{\$} increases from {\$}\backslashsim 0.25{\$} in low mass haloes ({\$}10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} {\{}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}} \backslashleq M \backslashlsim 2 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\$}) to {\$}\backslashsim 0.4{\$} in massive haloes ({\$}M \backslashgsim 5 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} {\{}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\$}). We show that these values of {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BNC{\}}{\$} are uncomfortably high compared to predictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BNC{\}}(M){\$}, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite kinematics.},

abstract = {We study the environmental dependence of the formation epoch of dark matter haloes in the Millennium Simulation: a ten billion particle N-body simulation of standard LambdaCDM cosmology. A sensitive test of this dependence - the marked correlation function - reveals highly significant evidence that haloes of a given mass form earlier in denser regions. We define a marked cross-correlation function, which helps quantify how this effect depends upon the choice of the halo population used to define the environment. The mean halo formation redshift as a function of the local overdensity in dark matter is also well determined, and we see an especially clear dependence for galaxy-sized haloes. This contradicts one of the basic predictions of the excursion set model of structure formation, even though we see that this theory predicts other features of the distribution of halo formation epochs rather well. It also invalidates an assumption usually employed in the popular halo, or HOD, models of galaxy clustering, namely that the distribution of halo properties is a function of halo mass but not of halo environment.},

We demonstrate that this new model can reproduce the power spectrum and bispectrum computed from cosmological simulations of both an n=-2 scale-free model and a low-density cold dark matter model. To enhance the dynamic range of these large simulations, we use the synthetic halo replacement technique of Ma {\&} Fry (2000a), where the original halos with numerically softened cores are replaced by synthetic halos of realistic density profiles. At high wavenumbers, our model predicts a slope for the nonlinear power spectrum different from the often-used fitting formulas in the literature based on the stable clustering assumption. Our model also predicts a three-point amplitude Q that is scale dependent, in contrast to the popular hierarchical clustering assumption. This model provides a rapid way to compute the mass power spectrum and bispectrum over all length scales where the input halo properties are valid. It also provides a physical interpretation of the clustering properties of matter in the universe.},

We confirm that the formation time, defined as the time when the virial mass of the main progenitor equals the mass enclosed within the scale radius, correlates strongly with concentration. We provide a semi-analytic model for halo mass history that combines analytic relations with fits to simulations. This model has the functional form, M(z) = M0(1 + z)$\alpha$e$\beta$z, where the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are directly correlated with concentration. We then combine this model for the halo mass history with the analytic relations between $\alpha$, $\beta$ and the linear power spectrum derived by Correa et al. to establish the physical link between halo concentration and the initial density perturbation field. Finally, we provide fitting formulae for the halo mass history as well as numerical routines. We derive the accretion rate as a function of halo mass, and demonstrate how the halo mass history depends on cosmology and the adopted definition of halo mass.},

abstract = {We use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy–galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z = 0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range m ± dm/2 that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low-mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low-mass galaxies at all redshifts, but also the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low-mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

abstract = {The XMM Large Scale Structure survey (XMM-LSS) is a medium deep large area X-ray survey. Its goal is to extend large scale structure investigations attempted using ROSAT cluster samples to two redshift bins between 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 while maintaining the precision of earlier studies. Two main goals have constrained the survey design: the evolutionary study of the cluster-cluster correlation function and of the cluster number density. The adopted observing configuration consists of an equatorial mosaic of 10 ks pointings, separated by 20′ and covering 8° × 8°, giving a pointsource sensitivity of ∼5 × 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.5-2 keV band. This will yield more than 800 clusters of galaxies and a sample of X-ray AGN with a space density of about 300 deg-2. We present the expected cosmological implications of the survey in the context of ACDM models and cluster evolution. We give an overview of the first observational results. The XMM-LSS survey is associated with several other major surveys, ranging from the UV to the radio wavebands, which will provide the necessary resources for X-ray source identification and further statistical studies. In particular, the associated CFHTLS weak lensing and AMiBA Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys over the entire XMM-LSS area will provide for the first time a comprehensive study of the mass distribution and of cluster physics in the universe on scales of a, few hundred Mpc. We describe the main characteristics of our wavelet-based X-ray pipeline and source identification procedures, including the classification of the cluster candidates by means of a photometric redshift analysis. This permits the selection of suitable targets for spectroscopic follow-up. We present preliminary results from the first 25 XMM-LSS pointings: X-ray source properties, optical counterparts, and highlights from the first Magellan and VLT/FORS2 spectroscopic runs as well as preliminary results from the NIR search for z {\textgreater} 1 clusters. The results are promising and, so far, in accordance with our predictions. In particular: (1) we reproduce the log N-log S distribution for point sources obtained from deeper surveys at our sensitivity; (2) we find a cluster number density of 15-20 deg-2; (3) for the first time, we statistically sample the group mass regime at a redshift out to ∼0.5. {\textcopyright}2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Broadband measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measure different regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

abstract = {It is common practice for methods that use galaxy clustering to constrain the galaxy-halo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and/or conditional luminosity function (CLF), to assume that halo mass alone suffices to determine a halo's resident galaxy population. Yet, the clustering strength of cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass, such as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We use halo abundance matching and age matching to construct fiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additional mock catalogs with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit a parameterized HOD to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies in each catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels of assembly bias. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs generally describe the true underlying HODs well, validating the basic methodology. However, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs have systematic errors that are statistically significant. In most cases, these systematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliary observables. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy clustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced by assembly bias. Our work suggests that efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be high priorities as it is a threatening source of systematic error in galaxy evolution studies as well as the precision cosmology program.},

abstract = {Using group catalogs from the SDSS DR7, we attempt to measure galactic conformity in the local universe. We measure the quenched fraction of neighbor galaxies around isolated primary galaxies, dividing the isolated sample into star-forming and quiescent objects. We restrict our measurements to scales {\$}{\textgreater}1{\$} Mpc to probe the correlations between the formation histories of distinct halos. Over the stellar mass range {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}9.7{\}} \backslashle M{\_}\backslashast/M{\_}\backslashodot \backslashle 10{\^{}}{\{}10.9{\}}{\$}, we find minimal statistical evidence for conformity. We further compare these data to predictions of the halo age-matching model, in which the oldest galaxies are associated with the oldest halos at fixed {\$}M{\_}\backslashast{\$}. For models with strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is too large to be consistent with the data. For weaker implementations of age-matching, galactic conformity is not a sensitive diagnostic of halo assembly bias, and would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data. We reproduce the results of Kauffmann et al 2013, in which the star formation rates of neighbor galaxies are significantly reduced around primary galaxies when the primaries are themselves low star formers. However, we find this result is mainly driven by contamination in the isolation criterion, when using our group catalog to remove the small fraction of satellite galaxies in the sample, the conformity signal largely goes away. Lastly, we show that small conformity signals, i.e., 2-5{\%} differences in the quenched fractions of neighbor galaxies, can be produced by mechanisms other than halo assembly bias. For example, if passive galaxies occupy more massive halos than star forming galaxies of the same stellar mass, a conformity signal that is consistent with recent measurements from PRIMUS (Berti et al 2016) can be produced.},

We test the FoF extraction for 16x16 pairs of LLs, using subsamples of galaxies, doubly complete in distance and luminosity, of a flux-limited mock SDSS galaxy catalog. We find that massive RSGs are more prone to fragmentation, while the fragments typically have low estimated mass, with typically 30{\%} of groups of low and intermediate estimated mass being fragments. Group merging rises drastically with estimated mass. For groups of 3 or more galaxies, galaxy completeness and reliability are both typically better than 80{\%} (after discarding the fragments). Estimated masses of extracted groups are biased low, by up to a factor 4 at low richness, while the inefficiency of mass estimation improves from 0.85 dex to 0.2 dex when moving from low to high multiplicity groups.

abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. A hypothetical galaxy catalogue depends on (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number -- the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat {\$}\backslashOmega=0.3{\$} model ({\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM), but not for an {\$}\backslashOmega=1{\$} model with the same power spectrum ({\$}\backslashtau{\$}CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high {\$}\backslashOmega{\$}, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

abstract = {In this paper we use the ``Millennium Simulation'' to re-examine the mass assembly history of dark matter halos and the age dependence of halo clustering. We use eight different definitions of halo formation times to characterize the different aspects of the assembly history of a dark matter halo. We find that these formation times have different dependence on halo mass. While some formation times characterize well the hierarchical nature of halo formation, in the sense that more massive halos have later formation, the trend is reversed for other definitions of the formation time. In particular, the formation times that are likely to be related to the formation of galaxies in dark halos show strong trends of ``down-sizing'', in that lower-mass halos form later. We also investigate how the correlation amplitude of dark matter halos depends on the different formation times. We find that this dependence is quite strong for some definitions of formation time but weak or absent for other definitions. In particular, the correlation amplitude of halos of a given mass is almost independent of their last major merger time. For the definitions that are expected to be more related to the formation of galaxies in dark halos, a significant assembly bias is found only for halos less massive than M{\_}*. We discuss our results in connection to the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos, the ``archaeological down-sizing'' observed in the galaxy population, and the observed color-dependence of the clustering strength of galaxy groups and clusters.},

abstract = {We give an overview of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), a NASA Explorer Mission launched on April 28, 2003. GALEX is performing the first space UV sky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750 Angstroms and 1750-2750 Angstroms). The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (m[AB] {\~{}} 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[AB] {\~{}} 23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[AB] {\~{}} 25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic grism surveys (R=100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the UV-global star formation rate relationship in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5, and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a Guest Investigator program supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey.},

abstract = {We extend the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework to generate mock galaxy catalogs exhibiting varying levels of "galactic conformity", which has emerged as a potentially powerful probe of environmental effects in galaxy evolution. Our model correlates galaxy colours in a group with the concentration of the common parent dark halo through a "group quenching efficiency" {\$}\backslashrho{\$} which makes older, more concentrated halos {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}at fixed mass{\}}{\$} preferentially host redder galaxies. We find that, for a specific value of {\$}\backslashrho{\$}, this 1-halo conformity matches corresponding measurements in a group catalog based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our mocks also display conformity at large separations from isolated objects, potentially an imprint of halo assembly bias. A detailed study - using mocks with assembly bias erased while keeping 1-halo conformity intact - reveals a rather nuanced situation, however. At separations {\$}\backslashlesssim 4{\$}Mpc, conformity is mainly a 1-halo effect dominated by the largest halos and is {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}not{\}}{\$} a robust indicator of assembly bias. Only at very large separations ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 8{\$}Mpc) does genuine 2-halo conformity, driven by the assembly bias of small halos, manifest distinctly. We explain all these trends in standard Halo Model terms. Our model opens the door to parametrized HOD analyses that self-consistently account for galactic conformity at all scales.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of {\~{}} 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {\textless} 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {\textgreater} 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

The sample covers 2/3 (8.27 sr) of the sky (|b|{\textgreater}20deg) and appears to have a good completeness in redshift (97{\%}). We select the sample on the basis of homogenized corrected total blue magnitudes in order to minimize systematic effects in galaxy sampling. We identify the groups in this sample by means of both the hierarchical and the percolation ``friends-of-friends'' methods. The resulting catalogs of loose groups appear to be similar and are among the largest catalogs of groups currently available. Most of the NOG galaxies ({\~{}}60{\%}) are found to be members of galaxy pairs ({\~{}}580 pairs for a total of {\~{}}15{\%} of objects) or groups with at least three members ({\~{}}500 groups for a total of {\~{}}45{\%} of objects). About 40{\%} of galaxies are left ungrouped (field galaxies). We illustrate the main features of the NOG galaxy distribution. Compared to previous optical and IRAS galaxy samples, the NOG provides a denser sampling of the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe. Given its large sky coverage, the identification of groups, and its high-density sampling, the NOG is suited to the analysis of the galaxy density field of the nearby universe, especially on small scales.},

abstract = {We explore the near-infrared (NIR) K-band properties of galaxies within 93 galaxy clusters and groups using data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. We use X-ray properties of these clusters to pinpoint cluster centers and estimate cluster masses. By stacking all these systems, we study the shape of the cluster luminosity function and the galaxy distribution within the clusters. We find that the galaxy profile is well described by the Navarro, Frenk, {\&} White (NFW) profile with a concentration parameter c {\~{}} 3, with no evidence for cluster mass dependence of the concentration. Using this sample, whose masses span the range from 3 × 1013 to 2 × 1015 M☉, we confirm the existence of a tight correlation between total galaxy NIR luminosity and cluster binding mass, which indicates that NIR light can serve as a cluster mass indicator. From the observed galaxy profile, together with cluster mass profile measurements from the literature, we find that the mass-to-light ratio is a weakly decreasing function of cluster radius and that it increases with cluster mass. We also derive the mean number of galaxies within halos of a given mass, the halo occupation number. We find that the mean number scales as N M0.84±0.04 for galaxies brighter than MK = -21, indicating that high-mass clusters have fewer galaxies per unit mass than low-mass clusters. Using published observations at high redshift, we show that higher redshift clusters have higher mean occupation numbers than nearby systems of the same mass. By comparing the luminosity function and radial distribution of galaxies in low-mass and high-mass clusters, we show that there is a marked decrease in the number density of galaxies fainter than M* as one moves to higher mass clusters; in addition, extremely luminous galaxies are more probable in high-mass clusters. We explore several processes, including tidal interactions and merging, as a way of explaining the variation in galaxy population with cluster mass.},

abstract = {The connection between galaxies and dark matter halos is often inferred from data using probabilistic models, such as the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD). Conventional HOD formulations assume that only halo mass governs the galaxy-halo connection. Violations of this assumption, known as galaxy assembly bias, threaten the HOD program. We introduce decorated HODs, a new, flexible class of models designed to account for assembly bias. Decorated HODs minimally expand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditional and novel HOD parameters. We use decorated HODs to quantify the influence of assembly bias on clustering and lensing statistics. For SDSS-like samples, the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering can be as large as a factor of two on r {\~{}} 200 kpc scales and {\~{}}15{\%} in the linear regime. Assembly bias can either enhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increases clustering on scales r {\textless}{\~{}} 1 Mpc. We performed our calculations with Halotools, an open-source, community-driven python package for studying the galaxy-halo connection (http://halotools.readthedocs.org).

abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey, for star-forming field galaxies with M*{\textgreater}{\~{}}1010 Msolar out to z=1.1. The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M*. With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged galaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories ($\tau$ models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e-folding times $\tau$, and a later onset of SF (zf). Our model can provide a first parameterization of SFR as a function of M* and z, and quantify mass dependences of $\tau$ and zf, from direct observations of M* and SFRs up to z{\textgreater}1. The observed evolution of SF in galaxies can plausibly reflect the dominance of gradual gas exhaustion. The data are also consistent with the history of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the luminosity and color-dependence of galaxy clustering at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0 in the PRIsm MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS). We quantify the clustering with the redshift-space and projected two-point correlation functions, xi(rp,pi) and wp(rp), using volume-limited samples constructed from a parent sample of over 130,000 galaxies with robust redshifts in seven independent fields covering 9 sq. deg. of sky. We quantify how the scale-dependent clustering amplitude increases with increasing luminosity and redder color, with relatively small errors over large volumes. We find that red galaxies have stronger small-scale (0.1{\textless}rp{\textless}1 Mpc/h) clustering and steeper correlation functions compared to blue galaxies, as well as a strong color dependent clustering within the red sequence alone. We interpret our measured clustering trends in terms of galaxy bias and obtain values between b{\_}gal=0.9-2.5, quantifying how galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter depending on their luminosity and color. We also interpret the color dependence with mock catalogs, and find that the clustering of blue galaxies is nearly constant with color, while redder galaxies have stronger clustering in the one-halo term due to a higher satellite galaxy fraction. In addition, we measure the evolution of the clustering strength and bias, and we do not detect statistically significant departures from passive evolution. We argue that the luminosity- and color-environment (or halo mass) relations of galaxies have not significantly evolved since z=1. Finally, using jackknife subsampling methods, we find that sampling fluctuations are important and that the COSMOS field is generally an outlier, due to having more overdense structures than other fields; we find that 'cosmic variance' can be a significant source of uncertainty for high-redshift clustering measurements.},

abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute nonlinear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter halos, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations betwen the halos and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. Galaxy power spectrum differs from dark matter power spectrum because pair weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters. In this case the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with the slope closed to the observed. Such a model also predicts a later onset of nonlinear clustering compared to the dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the CDM models with the data. Generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale dependent and nonmonotonic. For red or elliptical galaxies bias in power spectrum may be scale dependent even on very large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through the galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger halos host more than one galaxy. We discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum (ABRIDGED).},

abstract = {Most clusters and groups of galaxies contain a giant elliptical galaxy in their centers that far outshines and outweighs normal ellipticals. The origin of these brightest cluster galaxies is intimately related to the collapse and formation of the cluster. Using an N-body simulation of a cluster of galaxies in a hierarchical cosmological model, we show that galaxy merging naturally produces a massive central galaxy with surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles similar to those of observed BCGs. To enhance the resolution of the simulation, 100 dark halos at z = 2 are replaced with self-consistent disk + bulge + halo galaxy models following a Tully-Fisher relation using 100,000 particles for the 20 largest galaxies and 10,000 particles for the remaining ones. This technique allows us to analyze the stellar and dark-matter components independently. The central galaxy forms through the merger of several massive galaxies along a filament early in the cluster's history. Galactic cannibalism of smaller galaxies through dynamical friction over a Hubble time only accounts for a small fraction of the accreted mass. The galaxy is a flattened, triaxial object whose long axis aligns with the primordial filament and the long axis of the cluster galaxy distribution, agreeing with observed trends for galaxy cluster alignment.},

abstract = {We calculate stellar masses for ˜400 000 massive luminous galaxies at redshift ˜0.2-0.7 using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy distributions to u, g, r, i, z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies are used to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. Accurate BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow ($\Delta$log M ˜ 0.5 dex) and peaks at about log M/M⊙ ˜ 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2-0.6, in agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by BOSS extend over ˜1012 M⊙, providing unprecedented measurements of the high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number density above ˜2.5 × 1011 M⊙ agrees with previous determinations. We perform a comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance of massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but the models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with redshift is detected from ˜0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the lack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due to metallicity, which is too low in the models.},

abstract = {We combine data from a number of N-body simulations to predict the abundance of dark haloes in cold dark matter (CDM) universes over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10-30per cent at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our `Hubble volume' simulations of $\tau$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of `typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

abstract = {We present age distribution matching, a theoretical formalism for predicting how galaxies of luminosity L and color C occupy dark matter halos. Our model supposes that there are just two fundamental properties of a halo that determine the color and brightness of the galaxy it hosts: the maximum circular velocity Vmax, and the redshift z{\_}starve that correlates with the epoch at which the star formation in the galaxy ceases. The halo property z{\_}starve is intended to encompass physical characteristics of halo mass assembly that may deprive the galaxy of its cold gas supply and, ultimately, quench its star formation. The new, defining feature of the model is that, at fixed luminosity, galaxy color is in monotonic correspondence with z{\_}starve, with the larger values of z{\_}starve being assigned redder colors. We populate an N- body simulation with a mock galaxy catalog based on age distribution matching, and show that the resulting mock galaxy distribution accurately describes a variety of galaxy statistics. Our model suggests that halo and galaxy assembly are indeed correlated.

abstract = {We present a fully analytical halo model of colour-dependent clustering that incorporates the effects of galactic conformity in a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. The model, based on our previous numerical work, describes conformity through a correlation between the colour of a galaxy and the concentration of its parent halo, leading to a correlation between central and satellite galaxy colours at fixed halo mass. The strength of the correlation is set by a tunable `group quenching efficiency', and the model can separately describe group-level correlations between galaxy colour (1-halo conformity) and large scale correlations induced by assembly bias (2-halo conformity). We validate our analytical results using clustering measurements in mock galaxy catalogs, finding that the model is accurate at the 10-20 percent level for a wide range of luminosities and length scales. We apply the formalism to interpret the colour-dependent clustering of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find good overall agreement between the data and a model that has 1-halo conformity at a level consistent with previous results based on an SDSS group catalog, although the clustering data require satellites to be redder than suggested by the group catalog. Within our modelling uncertainties, however, we do not find strong evidence of 2-halo conformity driven by assembly bias in SDSS clustering.},

This sample spans more than 1.5 deg2 in four independent fields. Using rest-frame U-B color and [O II] equivalent widths, we distinguish star-forming from passive populations in order to explore the nature of ``downsizing''-a pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high-mass galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epochs. We identify a mass limit, MQ, above which star formation appears to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution in this threshold mass. We find that MQ decreases with time by a factor of {\~{}}3 across our redshift range according to MQ{\~{}}(1+z)3.5. To further constrain possible quenching mechanisms, we investigate how downsizing depends on local galaxy environment using the projected third-nearest-neighbor statistic Dp,3. For the majority of galaxies near the median density, there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment. However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median. Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the underdense regions. Our results significantly constrain recent suggestions for the origin of downsizing and indicate that the process for quenching star formation must, primarily, be internally driven.},

abstract = {Using a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of the concordance cosmology we inves-tigate how the formation histories, shapes and angular momenta of dark matter haloes depend on environment. We first present a classification scheme that allows us to distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple measure of the local density) is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to our simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M {\textless} M * (haloes of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are independent of it for larger masses (M * here indicates the typical mass scale which is entering the non-linear regime of perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in clusters are generally less spherical and more prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide accu-rate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the spatial autocorrelation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin–orbit correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in filaments.},

abstract = {Aims: We extract groups of galaxies as flux-limited and volume-limited samples from the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) to study the supercluster-void network and environmental properties of groups therein. Volume-limited catalogues are particularly useful for a comparison of numerical simulations of dark matter halos and the large-scale structure with observations. Methods: The extraction of a volume-limited sample of galaxies and groups requires special care to avoid excluding too much observational data. We use a modified friends-of-friends (FoF) method with a slightly variable linking length to obtain a preliminary flux-limited sample. We take the flux-limited groups as the basic sample to include as many galaxies as possible in the volume-limited samples. To determine the scaling of the linking length we calibrated group sizes and mean galaxy number densities within groups by magnitude dilution of a nearby group sub-sample to follow the properties of groups with higher luminosity limits. Results: Our final flux-limited sample contains 78800 groups and volume-limited subsamples with absolute magnitude limits Mr = -18, -19, -20, and -21 contain 5463, 12 590, 18 973, and 9139 groups, respectively, in the DR7 main galaxy main area survey. The group catalogue is available at the CDS. Conclusions: The spatial number densities of our groups within the subsamples, as well as the mean sizes and rms velocities of our groups practically do not change from sub-sample to sub-sample. This means that the catalogues are homogeneous and well suited for a comparison with simulations.

All four detector arrays in the camera are 256×256 pixels in size, with the two shorter wavelength channels using InSb and the two longer wavelength channels using Si:As IBC detectors. IRAC is a powerful survey instrument because of its high sensitivity, large field of view, and four-color imaging. This paper summarizes the in-flight scientific, technical, and operational performance of IRAC.},

abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semianalytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function {\textless}N{\textgreater}M for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. Since the number of central galaxies is always zero or one, the width of P(N|M) is narrower than a Poisson distribution at low N and approaches Poisson at high N. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1{\~{}}14Mmin (SPH) or M1{\~{}}18Mmin (SA). The stellar population age of central galaxies correlates with halo mass, and this correlation explains much of the age dependence of the galaxy HOD. The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M{\~{}}10Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. Using the SA model, we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a ``bump'' at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

abstract = {The photometric calibration of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a multi-step process which involves data from three different telescopes: the 1.0-m telescope at the US Naval Observatory (USNO), Flagstaff Station, Arizona (which was used to establish the SDSS standard star network); the SDSS 0.5-m Photometric Telescope (PT) at the Apache Point Observatory (APO), New Mexico (which calculates nightly extinctions and calibrates secondary patch transfer fields); and the SDSS 2.5-m telescope at APO (which obtains the imaging data for the SDSS proper).   In this paper, we describe the Monitor Telescope Pipeline, MTPIPE, the software pipeline used in processing the data from the single-CCD telescopes used in the photometric calibration of the SDSS (i.e., the USNO 1.0-m and the PT). We also describe transformation equations that convert photometry on the USNO-1.0m u'g'r'i'z' system to photometry the SDSS 2.5m ugriz system and the results of various validation tests of the MTPIPE software. Further, we discuss the semi-automated PT factory, which runs MTPIPE in the day-to-day standard SDSS operations at Fermilab. Finally, we discuss the use of MTPIPE in current SDSS-related projects, including the Southern u'g'r'i'z' Standard Star project, the u'g'r'i'z' Open Star Clusters project, and the SDSS extension (SDSS-II).},

Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 square degrees and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 square degrees (with about 85{\%} completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. We calculate and compile derived quantities (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically recalibrated, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from about 2{\%} to about 1{\%}. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag deblending and other errors. This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers, in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometrical description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog.},

abstract = {We investigate the ability of current implementations of galaxy group finders to recover colour-dependent halo occupation statistics. To test the fidelity of group catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used in the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic manner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar, and most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy. However, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence of correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite designation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo transition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these errors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct galaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), and to result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red galaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly recovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as function of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic conformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is present. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from group catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running group finders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on the HTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.},

abstract = {We explore the redshift evolution of a curious correlation between the star formation properties of central galaxies and their satellites (`galactic conformity') at intermediate to high redshift (0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.9). Using an extremely deep near-infrared survey, we study the distribution and properties of satellite galaxies with stellar masses, log(M*/M⊙) {\textgreater} 9.7, around central galaxies at the characteristic Schechter function mass, M ˜ M*. We fit the radial profiles of satellite number densities with simple power laws, finding slopes in the range -1.1 to -1.4 for mass-selected satellites, and -1.3 to -1.6 for passive satellites. We confirm the tendency for passive satellites to be preferentially located around passive central galaxies at 3$\sigma$ significance and show that it exists to at least z ˜ 2. Meanwhile, the quenched fraction of satellites around star-forming galaxies is consistent with field galaxies of equal stellar masses. We find no convincing evidence for a redshift-dependent evolution of these trends. One simple interpretation of these results is that only passive central galaxies occupy an environment that is capable of independently shutting off star formation in satellite galaxies. By examining the satellites of higher stellar mass star-forming galaxies (log(M*/M⊙) {\textgreater} 11), we conclude that the origin of galactic conformity is unlikely to be exclusively due to the host dark matter halo mass. A halo-mass-independent correlation could be established by either formation bias or a more physical connection between central and satellite star formation histories. For the latter, we argue that a star formation (or active galactic nucleus) related outburst event from the central galaxy could establish a hot halo environment which is then capable of quenching both central and satellite galaxies.},

abstract = {Two explanations have been put forward to explain the observed conformity between the colours and specific star formation rates (SFR/M *) of galaxies on large scales: (1) the formation times of their surrounding dark matter haloes are correlated (commonly referred to as 'assembly bias'), (2) gas is heated over large scales at early times, leading to coherent modulation of cooling and star formation between well-separated galaxies (commonly referred to as 'pre-heating'). To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias scenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in the neighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific SFRs. We find a significant excess of very high mass (log M * {\textgreater} 11.3) galaxies out to a distance of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/M * central galaxies compared to control samples of higher SFR/M * central galaxies with the same stellar mass and redshift. We also find that very massive galaxies in the neighbourhood of low-SFR/M * galaxies have much higher probability of hosting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). The radio-loud AGN fraction in neighbours with log M * {\textgreater} 11.3 is four times higher around passive, non star-forming centrals at projected distances of 1 Mpc and two times higher at projected distances of 4 Mpc. Finally, we carry out an investigation of conformity effects in the recently publicly released Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, which includes energetic input both from quasars and from radio mode accretion on to black holes. We do not find conformity effects of comparable amplitude on large scales in the simulations and we propose that gas needs to be pushed out of dark matter haloes more efficiently at high redshifts.},

abstract = {We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the ``halo occupation distribution'' (HOD), which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability P(N|M) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of $\xi$g(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

abstract = {We study the effects of local environment and stellar mass on galaxy properties using a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming systems in the COSMOS field at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 3. We show that at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, the median star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR) of all galaxies depend on environment, but they become independent of environment at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1. However, we find that only for $\backslash$textit{\{}star-forming{\}} galaxies, the median SFR and sSFR are similar in different environments, regardless of redshift and stellar mass. We find that the quiescent fraction depends on environment at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, and on stellar mass out to {\$}z\backslashsim{\$} 3. We show that at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, galaxies become quiescent faster in denser environments and that the overall environmental quenching efficiency increases with cosmic time. Environmental and mass quenching processes depend on each other. At {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses (log({\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}){\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more efficient in denser regions. We show that the overall mass quenching efficiency ({\$}\backslashepsilon{\_}{\{}mass{\}}{\$}) for more massive galaxies (log({\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}){\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.2) rises with cosmic time until {\$}z\backslashsim{\$} 1 and flattens out since then. However, for less massive galaxies, the rise in {\$}\backslashepsilon{\_}{\{}mass{\}}{\$} continues to the present time. Our results suggest that environmental quenching is only relevant at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, likely a fast process, whereas mass quenching is the dominant mechanism at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1, with a possible stellar feedback physics.},

We confirm the previously-reported excess of co-rotating satellite pairs located near diametric opposition with respect to their host, but show that this signal is unlikely to be due to rotating discs (or planes) of satellites. In particular, no overabundance of co-rotating satellites pairs is observed within ∼ 20 • − 50 • of direct opposition, as would be expected for planar distributions inclined relative to the line-of-sight. Instead, the excess co-rotation for satellite pairs within ∼ 10 • of opposition is consistent with random noise associated with undersampling of an underlying isotropic velocity distribution. Based upon the observed dynamics of the luminous satellite population, we conclude that at most 10{\%} of isolated hosts harbor co-rotating satellite planes.},

abstract = {We show, with the help of large N-body simulations, that the real-space two-point correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies can both be measured reliably from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. The real-space correlation function is well fitted by the power law {\$}\backslashxi(r)=(r{\_}0/r){\^{}}\backslashgamma{\$} with {\$}r{\_}0=(5.06\backslashpm0.12)\backslashmpc{\$} and {\$}\backslashgamma=1.862\backslashpm 0.034{\$}, and the pairwise velocity dispersion at {\$}1\backslashmpc{\$} is {\$}(570\backslashpm 80)\backslashkms{\$}. A detailed comparison between these observational results and the predictions of current CDM cosmogonies is carried out. We construct 60 mock samples for each theoretical model from a large set of high resolution N-body simulations, which allows us to include various observational selection effects in the analyses and to use exactly the same methods for both real and theoretical samples. We demonstrate that such a procedure is essential in the comparison between models and observations. The observed two-point correlation function is significantly flatter than the mass correlation function in current CDM models on scales {\$}\backslashla 1\backslashmpc{\$}. The observed pairwise velocity dispersion is also lower than that of dark matter particles in these models. We propose a simple antibias model to explain these discrepancies. This model assumes that the number of galaxies per unit dark matter mass, {\$}N/M{\$}, decreases with the mass of dark haloes. The predictions of CDM models with {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8\backslashOmega{\_}0{\^{}}{\{}0.6{\}}\backslashsim 0.4{\$}-0.5 and {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}0 h\backslashsim 0.2{\$} are in agreement with the observational results, if the trend of {\$}N/M{\$} with {\$}M{\$} is at the level already observed for rich clusters of galaxies. Thus CDM models with cluster-abundance normalization are consistent with the observed correlation function and pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies. A high level of velocity bias is not required in these models.},

abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of {\~{}}50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z{\~{}}0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (H$\alpha$). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H$\alpha$ measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak H$\alpha$, and where H$\alpha$ is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no H$\alpha$ show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

abstract = {Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 106 spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg2, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49d in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55" during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92{\%} for all targets, and greater than 99{\%} for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90{\%} (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys.},

The comparison is made for a large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three different cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and open cold dark matter). We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multi-fibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2-degree diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than b{\_}J=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80deg x 15deg around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75deg x 10deg along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 sq.deg and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93{\%} over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600A-8000A at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0A and a median S/N of 13 per pixel. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q{\textgreater}=3 redshifts are 98.4{\%} reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km/s. The overall redshift completeness for Q{\textgreater}=3 redshifts is 91.8{\%}, but this varies with magnitude from 99{\%} for the brightest galaxies to 90{\%} for objects at the survey limit. The 2dFGRS database is available on the WWW at http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS},

abstract = {(Summary) Using the conditional luminosity function (CLF) -- the luminosity distribution of galaxies in a dark matter halo -- as the fundamental building block, we present an empirical model for the galaxy distribution. The model predictions are compared with the published luminosity function and clustering statistics from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts, and galaxy correlation functions from COMBO-17 survey at a redshift of 0.6, DEEP2 survey at a redshift of unity, and Great Observatories Deep Origins Survey (GOODS) at a redshift around 3. The comparison with statistical measurements allows us to constrain certain parameters related to analytical descriptions that describe the relation between a dark matter halo and its central galaxy luminosity, its satellite galaxy luminosity, and the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies of that halo. The single parameter best constrained by clustering measurements is the total satellite galaxy luminosity averaged over the halo mass distribution probed by the galaxy sample. For SDSS, {\$}{\textless}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sat{\}}{\textgreater} =(2.1{\^{}}{\{}+0.8{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.4{\}}) \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} h{\$}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} L{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashsun{\}}{\$}, while for GOODS at {\$}z \backslashsim 3{\$}, {\$}{\textless}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sat{\}}{\textgreater} {\textless} 2 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$} h{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} L{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashsun{\}}{\$}. Quantities such as the fraction of satellite galaxies at a given galaxy luminosity are not strongly constrained with SDSS data. We use our CLFs to establish probability distribution of halo mass in which galaxies of a given luminosity could be found either at halo centers or as satellites. Finally, to help establish further properties of the galaxy distribution, we propose the measurement of cross-clustering between galaxies divided into two distinctly different luminosity bins.},

abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M ⊙ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\~{}} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\~{}} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in $\Lambda$CDM. Constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relationship and SFRs are available for download online.},

abstract = {We study dynamical mass measurements of galaxy clusters contaminated by interlopers and show that a modern machine learning algorithm can predict masses by better than a factor of two compared to a standard scaling relation approach. We create two mock catalogs from Multidark's publicly available N-body MDPL1 simulation, one with perfect galaxy cluster membership information and the other where a simple cylindrical cut around the cluster center allows interlopers to contaminate the clusters. In the standard approach, we use a power-law scaling relation to infer cluster mass from galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion. Assuming perfect membership knowledge, this unrealistic case produces a wide fractional mass error distribution, with awidth of  D » 0.87. Interlopers introduce additional scatter, significantly widening the error distribution further ( D » 2.13). We employ the support distribution machine (SDM) class of algorithms to learn from distributions of data to predict single values. Applied to distributions of galaxy observables such as LOS velocity and projected distance from the cluster center, SDM yields better than a factor-of-two improvement ( D » 0.67) for the contaminated case. Remarkably, SDM applied to contaminated clusters is better able to recover masses than even the scaling relation approach applied to uncontaminated clusters. We show that the SDM method more accurately reproduces the cluster mass function, making it a valuable tool for employing cluster observations to evaluate cosmological models.},

abstract = {We study the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, starting from a sample of {\~{}}200,000 galaxies over 2500 deg2. We concentrate our analysis on volume-limited subsamples of specified luminosity ranges, for which we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp), which is directly related to the real-space correlation function $\xi$(r). The amplitude of wp(rp) rises continuously with luminosity from Mr{\~{}}-17.5 to Mr{\~{}}-22.5, with the most rapid increase occurring above the characteristic luminosity L* (Mr{\~{}}-20.5). Over the scales 0.1 h-1 Mpc{\textless}rp{\textless}10 h-1 Mpc, the measurements for samples with Mr{\textgreater}-22 can be approximated, imperfectly, by power-law three-dimensional correlation functions $\xi$(r)=(r/r0)-$\gamma$ with $\gamma${\~{}}1.8 and r0(L*){\~{}}5.0 h-1 Mpc. The brightest subsample, -23{\textless}Mr{\textless}-22, has a significantly steeper $\xi$(r). When we divide samples by color, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function at all luminosities. The correlation amplitude of blue galaxies increases continuously with luminosity, but the luminosity dependence for red galaxies is less regular, with bright red galaxies exhibiting the strongest clustering at large scales and faint red galaxies exhibiting the strongest clustering at small scales. We interpret these results using halo occupation distribution (HOD) models assuming concordance cosmological parameters. For most samples, an HOD model with two adjustable parameters fits the wp(rp) data better than a power law, explaining inflections at rp{\~{}}1-3 h-1 Mpc as the transition between the one-halo and two-halo regimes of $\xi$(r). The implied minimum mass for a halo hosting a central galaxy more luminous than L grows steadily, with Mmin{\~{}}L at low luminosities and a steeper dependence above L*. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M1{\~{}}23Mmin(L), at all luminosities. These results imply a conditional luminosity function (at fixed halo mass) in which central galaxies lie far above a Schechter function extrapolation of the satellite population. The HOD model fits nicely explain the color dependence of wp(rp) and the cross correlation between red and blue galaxies. For galaxies with Mr{\textless}-21, halos slightly above Mmin have blue central galaxies, while more massive halos have red central galaxies and predominantly red satellite populations. The fraction of blue central galaxies increases steadily with decreasing luminosity and host halo mass. The strong clustering of faint red galaxies follows from the fact that nearly all of them are satellite systems in high-mass halos. The HOD fitting results are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of numerical and semianalytic models of galaxy formation.},

We split the sample both by luminosity and galaxy type and use a halo-model analysis to find halo-occupation distributions that can simultaneously model the clustering of all, early- and late-type galaxies in a given sample. Our results for the full galaxy sample are generally consistent with previous results using the SDSS spectroscopic sample, taking the differences between the median redshifts of the photometric and spectroscopic samples into account. We find that our early- and late-type measurements cannot be fit by a model that allows early- and late-type galaxies to be well mixed within haloes. Instead, we introduce a new model that segregates early- and late-type galaxies into separate haloes to the maximum allowed extent. We determine that, in all cases, it provides a good fit to our data and thus provides a new statistical description of the manner in which early- and late-type galaxies occupy haloes.},

abstract = {[abridged] We present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter halo properties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (FOF), spherical-overdensity (SO) and phase-space based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allows halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. All the halo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Via a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).},

abstract = {In this work, we investigate in detail the effects the local environment (groups and pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the Milky Way (L* galaxies). A volume limited sample of 6150 galaxies are visually classified to determine the emission features, morphological type and presence of a disc. This large sample allows for the significant characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass and group halo mass), and their codependencies determined. We observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role in shaping the evolution within a group halo; the main role of halo mass is in gathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. Dominant pair galaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratio is close to 1; otherwise, we observe the same galaxies as we would in an unpaired system. The minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by its companion galaxy, and while the star-forming fraction is always suppressed relative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower still when the mass ratio of a pair system increases. We find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as a function of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. We find evidence of a local peak of interactions for Milky Way stellar mass galaxies in Milky Way halo mass groups. Low-mass haloes, and in particular Local Group mass haloes, are an important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of a unit of stellar mass. We find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs, where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission class conformity is dominant in pairs. This suggests that group scale conformity is the result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, while pair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.},

abstract = {We investigate the origin of halo assembly bias, the dependence of halo clustering on assembly history. We relate halo assembly to peak properties measured in the Lagrangian space of the initial linear Gaussian random density field, and show how these same Lagrangian properties determine large-scale bias. We focus on the two regimes where assembly bias has been observed to be significant: at masses very large and very small compared to the nonlinear mass scale. At high masses, we show that assembly bias is expected from the statistics of the peaks of Gaussian random fluctuations, and we show that the extent of assembly bias found in N-body simulations of rare halos is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction. At low masses, we argue that assembly bias largely arises from a sub-population of low mass halos whose mass accretion has ceased. Due to their arrested development, these halos naturally become unbiased, in contrast to their anti-biased peers. We show that a simple toy model incorporating these effects can roughly reproduce the bias trends found in N-body simulations.},

abstract = {Satellite galaxies in rich clusters are subject to numerous physical processes that can significantly influence their evolution. However, the typical L* satellite galaxy resides in much lower mass galaxy groups, where the processes capable of altering their evolution are generally weaker and have had less time to operate. To investigate the extent to which satellite and central galaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M* -Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. This relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass function while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against recent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z {\~{}} 0 the satellites, on average, have {\~{}}10{\%} larger stellar masses at fixed peak subhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass. This is required in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2PCF and satellite fractions. At low masses our model slightly under-predicts the correlation function at {\~{}}1 Mpc scales. At z {\~{}} 1 the satellite and central galaxy M*-Mh relations are consistent within the errors, and the model provides an excellent fit to the clustering data. At present, the errors on the clustering data at z {\~{}} 2 are too large to constrain the satellite model. A simple model in which satellite and central galaxies share the same M*-Mh relation is able to reproduce the extant z {\~{}} 2 clustering data. We speculate that the striking similarity between the satellite and central galaxy M*-Mh relations since z {\~{}} 2 arises because the central galaxy relation evolves very weakly with time and because the stellar mass of the typical satellite galaxy has not changed significantly since it was accreted.

abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z{\textless}0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 $\mu$m photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 $\sigma${\textless}{\~{}}+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend {\~{}}67{\%}(95{\%}) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\~{}}2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z{\~{}}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z{\~{}}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at zlesssim 2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z = 0 for virial masses in the range 1011 h-1 M⊙ {\textless}= M{\textless}= 1015 h-1 M⊙ to lesssim5{\%}, improving on previous results by a factor of 2-3. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z = 0 and earlier epochs. Earlier studies have sought to calibrate a universal mass function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal function at this level or accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ≈20{\%}-50{\%}, depending on the mass definition, from z = 0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

abstract = {We introduce a simple model to self-consistently connect the growth of galaxies to the formation history of their host dark matter haloes. Our model is defined by two simple functions: the `baryonic growth function' which controls the rate at which new baryonic material is made available for star formation, and the `physics function' which controls the efficiency with which this material is converted into stars. Using simple, phenomenologically motivated forms for both functions that depend only on a single halo property, we demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce the z = 0 red and blue stellar mass functions. Furthermore, by adding redshift as a second input variable to the physics function we show that the reproduction of the global stellar mass function out to z = 3 is improved. We conclude by discussing the general utility of our new model, highlighting its usefulness for creating mock galaxy samples which have a number of key advantages over those generated by other techniques.},

abstract = {We analyse the bivariate distribution, in color versus absolute magnitude (u-r vs. M{\_}r), of a low redshift sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; 2400 deg{\^{}}2, 0.004{\textless}z{\textless}0.08, -23.5{\textless}M{\_}r{\textless}-15.5). We trace the bimodality of the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting double-Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead, the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well fit by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04, -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy properties over about two magnitudes. The midpoints of the transitions (M{\_}r=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions, respectively) occur around 2x10{\^{}}10 M{\_}solar after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude and a shallower faint-end slope (M{\^{}}*=-21.5, alpha=-0.8) compared to the blue distribution (alpha=-1.3 depending on the parameterization). These are approximately converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses greater than about 3x10{\^{}}10 M{\_}solar. Using a simple merger model, we show that the differences between the two functions are consistent with the red distribution being formed from major galaxy mergers.},

@article{Lacerna2011,
abstract = {We present a new proxy for the overdensity peak height for which the large-scale clustering of haloes of a given mass does not vary significantly with the assembly history. The peak height, usually taken to be well represented by the virial mass, can instead be approximated by the mass inside spheres of different radii, which in some cases can be larger than the virial radius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo. The sphere radii are defined as r = {\$}a{\$} delta{\_}t + {\$}b{\$} log{\_}10(M{\_}vir/M{\_}nl), where delta{\_}t is the age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial mass M{\_}vir, M{\_}nl is the non-linear mass, and {\$}a{\$}=0.2 and {\$}b{\$}=-0.02 are the free parameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect. Note that {\$}r{\$} depends on both halo mass and age. In this new approach, some of the objects which were initially considered low-mass peaks belong to regions with higher overdensities. At large scales, i.e. in the two-halo regime, this model properly recovers the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height of the mass peak alone, in contrast to the usual definition (virial mass) that shows a strong dependence on additional halo properties such as formation time. The dependence on the age in the one-halo term is also remarkably reduced. The population of galaxies whose "peak height" changes with this new definition consists mainly of old stellar populations and are preferentially hosted by low-mass haloes located near more massive objects. The latter is in agreement with recent results which indicate that old, low-mass haloes would suffer truncation of mass accretion by nearby larger haloes or simply due to the high density of their surroundings, thus showing an assembly bias effect. The change in mass is small enough that the Sheth et al. (2001) mass function is still a good fit to the resulting distribution of new masses.},

abstract = {Quenched central galaxies tend to reside in a preferentially quenched large-scale environment, a phenomenon that has been dubbed galactic conformity. Remarkably, this tendency persists out to scales far larger than the virial radius of the halo hosting the central. Therefore, conformity manifestly violates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir exclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a series studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the galaxy-dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity on scales R {\~{}}1-5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be correctly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that ejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then invoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of galaxies and halos. We find that this model produces a strong signal, and that central galaxies are solely responsible. We conclude that large-scale `2-halo' conformity represents a smoking gun of central galaxy assembly bias, and indicates that contemporary models of satellite quenching have systematically over-estimated the influence of post-infall processes.},

abstract = {We analyze the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour with two-point clustering statistics, using data from the Galaxy Zoo, the largest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present two-point correlation functions of spiral and early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology and environment with marked correlation functions. These yield clear and precise environmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similar measurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the Galaxy Zoo classifications themselves are very precise. We measure morphology marked correlation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak, with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales, indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. At fixed morphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong, and these correlations remain for fixed morphology $\backslash$textit{\{}and{\}} luminosity. An implication of this is that much of the morphology--density relation is due to the relation between colour and density. Our results also have implications for galaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usually accompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. A spiral galaxy may move onto the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagram without quickly becoming an early-type. We analyze the significant population of red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located in moderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirts of haloes. Finally, we combine our results to argue that central and satellite galaxies tend to follow different evolutionary paths.},

Here we summarize the science case feasible for a survey of Subaru 300 nights. We describe plans to constrain the nature of dark energy via a survey of emission line galaxies spanning a comoving volume of 9.3 (Gpc/h){\^{}}3 in the redshift range 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}2.4. In each of 6 redshift bins, the cosmological distances will be measured to 3{\%} precision via BAO, and redshift-space distortions will be used to constrain structure growth to 6{\%} precision. In the GA program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way and M31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies and the structure of their dark matter halos. Data will be secured for 10{\^{}}6 stars in the Galactic thick-disk, halo and tidal streams as faint as V{\~{}}22, including stars with V {\textless} 20 to complement the goals of the Gaia mission. A medium-resolution mode with R = 5000 to be implemented in the red arm will allow the measurement of multiple alpha-element abundances and more precise velocities for Galactic stars, elucidating the detailed chemo-dynamical structure and evolution of each of the main stellar components of the Milky Way Galaxy and of its dwarf spheroidal galaxies. For the extragalactic program, our simulations suggest the wide avelength range will be powerful in probing the galaxy population and its clustering over a wide redshift range. We propose to conduct a color-selected survey of 1{\textless}z{\textless}2 galaxies and AGN over 16 deg{\^{}}2 to J{\~{}}23.4, yielding a fair sample of galaxies with stellar masses above {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}Ms at z{\~{}}2.

abstract = {We compare the B-band luminosity function of virialized halos with the mass function predicted by the Press-Schechter theory in cold dark matter cosmogonies. We find that all cosmological models fail to match our results if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed. In order for these models to match the faint end of the luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio decreasing with luminosity as {\$}L{\^{}}{\{}-0.5\backslashpm 0.06{\}}{\$} is required. For a {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, the mass-to-light function has a minimum of {\$}\backslashsim 100 h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\_}{\{}75{\}}{\$} in solar units in the {\$}B{\$}-band, corresponding to {\$}\backslashsim 25{\%}{\$} of the baryons in the form of stars, and this minimum occurs close to the luminosity of an {\$}L{\^{}}*{\$} galaxy. At the high-mass end, the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model requires a mass-to-light ratio increasing with luminosity as {\$}L{\^{}}{\{}+0.5 \backslashpm 0.26{\}}{\$}. We also derive the halo occupation number, i.e. the number of galaxies brighter than {\$}\backslashlgal{\^{}}*{\$} hosted in a virialized system. We find that the halo occupation number scales non-linearly with the total mass of the system, {\$}N\backslashsbr{\{}gal{\}}({\textgreater}\backslashlgal{\^{}}*) \backslashpropto m{\^{}}{\{}0.55\backslashpm0.026{\}}{\$} or the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model. We find a break in the power-law slope of the X-ray-to-optical luminosity relation, independent of the cosmological model. This break occurs at a scale corresponding to poor groups. In the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, the poor-group mass is also the scale at which the mass-to-light ratio of virialized systems begins to increase. This correspondence suggests a physical link between star formation and the X-ray properties of halos, possibly due to preheating by supernovae or to efficient cooling of low-entropy gas into galaxies.},

abstract = {Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing probe the connection between galaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. On one hand, the halo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties of galaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. Consequently, different cosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. On the other hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actual mass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to constrain cosmological parameters. In this paper we establish the link between galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity function (CLF). We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies. The resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. For a cosmology with {\$}(\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}},\backslashsigma{\_}8)=(0.238,0.734){\$}, the model accurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the SDSS. For a comparison cosmology with {\$}(\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm m{\}},\backslashsigma{\_}8)=(0.3,0.9){\$}, however, we can accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of the galaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are too high, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. We conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential to yield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Since this method mainly probes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary to constraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes the large-scale (linear) matter distribution.},

@article{Kauffmann2013a,
abstract = {The observed correlation between star-formation in central galaxies and in their neighbours (a phenomenon dubbed galactic conformity) is in need of a convincing physical explanation. We use a volume-limited sample of galaxies with redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the SDSS DR7 to investigate the scale dependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the central galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range spanning two orders of magnitude. In central galaxies with masses less than 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond the virial radii of their dark matter halos. For low mass central galaxies, large-scale conformity with neighbours is only seen when the centrals have low star formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses, conformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly confined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of the central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al (2011) models shows that conformity-like effects are much weaker than observed, and apply only to the low SFR/M* tail of neighbouring galaxies. In the models, the median and the upper percentiles of the SFR/M* distribution remain almost unchanged, which is in contradiction with the data. Conformity between low-mass, gas-poor central galaxies and their distant neighbours cannot be explained within the framework of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. It is likely a signature of pre-heating of the intergalactic gas at an earlier epoch. The smaller-scale conformity between high-mass, gas-rich central galaxies and their close neighbours may be a signature of ongoing gas accretion onto central galaxies in a minority of massive dark matter halos.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos, substructure, and tidal features. The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named Rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 10{\^{}}5 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}10 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper (Knebe et al 2011) has shown Rockstar to have class-leading recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery as compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results which demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or satellite average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km/s at z=0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar .},

An empirical relation between the distribution functions of total stellar mass of galaxies and host halo mass, tuned to match the spatial density of galaxies over 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 and the clustering properties at z [{\~{}}] 0, is extended to include two different scenarios describing the variation of SFR on Mh. We also present new measurements of the redshift evolution of the average SFR for star-forming galaxies of different stellar masses up to z = 2, using data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey for infrared bright galaxies. Combining the EHM with the halo accretion histories from numerical simulations, we trace the stellar mass growth and star-formation history in haloes spanning a range of masses. We find that: (1) the intensity of the star-forming activity in haloes in the probed mass range has steadily decreased from z [{\~{}}] 2 to 0; (2) at a given epoch, haloes in the mass range between a few times 1011 M{\{}odot{\}} and a few times 1012 M{\{}odot{\}} are the most efficient at hosting star formation; (3) the peak of SFR density shifts to lower mass haloes over time; and (4) galaxies that are forming stars most actively at z [{\~{}}] 2 evolve into quiescent galaxies in today's group environments, strongly supporting previous claims that the most powerful starbursts at z [{\~{}}] 2 are progenitors of today's elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {Marked statistics allow sensitive tests of how galaxy properties correlate with environment, as well as of how correlations between galaxy properties are affected by environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is developed, which incorporates the effects which arise from the facts that typical galaxy marks (e.g. luminosity, colour, star formation rate, stellar mass) depend on the mass of the parent halo, and that massive haloes extend to larger radii and populate denser regions. Comparison with measured marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good agreement on scales smaller than a megaparsec, and excellent agreement on larger scales. The halo-model description shows clearly that the behaviour of some low-order marked statistics on these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy mark as a function of halo mass, but is insensitive to mark gradients within haloes. Higher-order statistics encode information about higher-order moments of the distribution of marks within haloes. This information is obtained without ever having to identify haloes or clusters in the galaxy distribution. On scales smaller than a megaparsec, the halo-model calculation shows that marked statistics allow sensitive tests of whether or not central galaxies in haloes are a special population. A prescription for including more general mark gradients in the halo-model description is also provided. The formalism developed here is particularly well suited to interpretation of marked statistics in astrophysical data sets, because it is phrased in the same language that is currently used to interpret more standard measures of galaxy clustering.},

abstract = {Using data taken as part of the Bluedisk project, we study the connection between neutral hydrogen (H i) in the environment of spiral galaxies and that in the galaxies themselves. We measure the total H i mass present in the environment in a statistical way by studying the distribution of noise peaks in the H i data cubes obtained for 40 galaxies observed with Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We find that galaxies whose H i mass fraction is high relative to standard scaling relations have an excess H i mass in the surrounding environment as well. Gas in the environment consists of gas clumps which are individually below the detection limit of our H i data. These clumps may be hosted by small satellite galaxies and/or be the high-density peaks of a more diffuse gas distribution in the intergalactic medium.

abstract = {We study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clustering is described in terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, clustering statistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales, correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory with halo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, and galaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function of halo mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power spectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and the galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales than their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. We find that requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the APM galaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at large scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small masses, m =10{\^{}}10 Msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number of galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass limit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity function or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum, bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. Although halo models agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher order Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are spherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the bispectrum at small scales. We stress the importance of finite volume effects in higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.},

abstract = {We address the origin of the robust bimodality observed in galaxy properties about a characteristic stellar mass {\~{}}3 × 1010Msolar. Less massive galaxies tend to be ungrouped blue star forming discs, while more massive galaxies are typically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap between the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at z{\~{}} 1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L*, and massive starbursts at z{\~{}} 2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of the inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback processes, all functions of the dark matter halo mass and associated with a similar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass Mshock{\textless}{\~{}} 1012Msolar, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial shock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova feedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a `fundamental line'. Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M{\textgreater}=Mshock haloes preferentially at z{\textgreater}= 2 lead to massive starbursts in L {\textgreater} L* galaxies. At z {\textless} 2, in M {\textgreater} Mshock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock, and being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such as active galactic nuclei. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading by passive evolution to `red-and-dead' massive spheroids starting at z{\~{}} 1. A minimum in feedback efficiency near Mshock explains the observed minimum in M/L and the qualitative features of the star formation history. The cold flows provide a hint for solving the angular momentum problem. When these processes are incorporated in simulations they recover the main bimodality features and solve other open puzzles.},

abstract = {We use the conditional luminosity function $\Phi$(L|M) dL, which gives the number of galaxies with luminosities in the range L+/- d L/2 that reside in a halo of mass M, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. Starting from the number density of dark matter haloes predicted by current models of structure formation, we seek the form of $\Phi$(L|M) that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the galaxy clustering strength. We test the models of $\Phi$(L|M) by comparing the resulting mass-to-light ratios with constraints from the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and from galaxy clusters. A comparison between model predictions and current observations yields a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy between $\Omega$0 and the power-spectrum normalization $\sigma$8, inherent in current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmogonies with $\sigma$8 normalized by recent weak gravitational lensing observations, the best results are obtained for $\Omega$0{\~{}} 0.3; $\Omega$0{\textless}{\~{}} 0.2 leads to too large galaxy correlation lengths, while $\Omega$0{\textgreater}{\~{}} 0.4 gives too high mass-to-light ratios to match the observed TF relation. The best-fitting model for the $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology with $\Omega$0= 0.3 and $\Omega$$\Lambda$= 0.7 predicts mass-to-light ratios that are slightly too high to match the TF relation. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this problem, such as small modifications of $\sigma$8 and the Hubble parameter with respect to the concordance values, the assumption that the Universe is dominated by warm dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the existence of dark galaxies. We use the conditional luminosity function derived from the present data to predict several statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe. We show that roughly 50 per cent of all light is produced in haloes less massive than 2 × 1012h-1 Msolar. We also derive the probability distribution P(M|L) dM that a galaxy of luminosity L resides in a halo with virial masses in the range M+/- dM/2.},

abstract = {We present a comparison of three cluster finding algorithms from imaging data using Monte Carlo simulations of clusters embedded in a 25 deg 2 region of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data: the Matched Filter (MF; Postman et al. 1996), the Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF; Kepner et al. 1999) and a color-magnitude filtered Voronoi Tessellation Technique (VTT). Among the two matched filters, we find that the MF is more efficient in detecting faint clusters, whereas the AMF evaluates the redshifts and richnesses more accurately, therefore suggesting a hybrid method (HMF) that combines the two. The HMF outperforms the VTT when using a background that is uniform, but it is more sensitive to the presence of a non-uniform galaxy background than is the VTT; this is due to the assumption of a uniform background in the HMF model. We thus find that for the detection thresholds we determine to be appropriate for the SDSS data, the performance of both algorithms are similar; we present the selection function for each method evaluated with these thresholds as a function of redshift and richness. For simulated clusters generated with a Schechter luminosity function (Mr = -21.5 and alpha = -1.1) both algorithms are complete for Abell richness 1 clusters up to z {\~{}} 0.4 for a sample magnitude limited to r = 21. While the cluster parameter evaluation shows a mild correlation with the local background density, the detection efficiency is not significantly affected by the background fluctuations, unlike previous shallower surveys.},

abstract = {We analyse the u-r color distribution of 24346 galaxies with Mr{\textless}=-18 and z{\textless}0.08, drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey first data release, as a function of luminosity and environment. The color distribution is well fit with two Gaussian distributions, which we use to divide the sample into a blue and red population. At fixed luminosity, the mean color of the blue (red) distribution is nearly independent of environment, with a weakly significant ({\~{}}3sigma) detection of a trend for colors to become redder by 0.1-0.14 (0.03-0.06) mag with a factor {\~{}}100 increase in local density, as characterised by the surface density of galaxies within a +/-1000 km/s redshift slice. In contrast, at fixed luminosity the fraction of galaxies in the red distribution is a strong function of local density, increasing from {\~{}}10-30 per cent of the population in the lowest density environments, to {\~{}}70 per cent at the highest densities. The strength of this trend is similar for both the brightest (-23{\textless}Mr{\textless}-22) and faintest (-19{\textless}Mr{\textless}-18) galaxies in our sample. The fraction of red galaxies within the virialised regions of clusters shows no significant dependence on velocity dispersion. Even at the lowest densities explored, a substantial population of red galaxies exists, which might be fossil groups. We propose that most star-forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is determined primarily by their intrinsic properties, and independent of their environment. Any environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red colors must either occur on a short timescale, or preferentially at high redshift, to preserve the simple Gaussian nature of the color distribution. The mechanism must be effective for both bright and faint galaxies.},

The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions.

abstract = {We study satellite galaxy abundances by counting photometric galaxies from the Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS/DR8) around isolated bright primary galaxies from SDSS/DR7. We present results as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass and colour of the satellites, and of the stellar mass and colour of the primaries. For massive primaries (log M★/M⊙ {\textgreater} 11.1) the luminosity and stellar mass functions of satellites with log M★/M⊙ {\textgreater} 8 are similar in shape to those of field galaxies, but for lower mass primaries they are significantly steeper, even accounting for exclusion effects due to the isolation criteria. The steepening is particularly marked for the stellar mass function. Satellite abundance increases strongly with primary stellar mass, approximately in proportion to expected dark halo mass. For log M★/M⊙ {\textgreater} 10.8, red primaries have more satellites than blue ones of the same stellar mass. The effect exceeds a factor of 2 at log M★/M⊙ ∼ 11.2. Satellite galaxies are systematically redder than field galaxies of the same stellar mass, except around primaries with log M★/M⊙ {\textless} 10.8, where their colours are similar or even bluer. Satellites are also systematically redder around more massive primaries. At fixed primary mass, they are redder around red primaries. We select similarly isolated galaxies from mock catalogues based on the galaxy formation simulations of Guo et al. and analyse them in parallel with the SDSS data. The simulation reproduces all the above trends qualitatively, except for the steepening of the satellite luminosity and stellar mass functions with decreasing primary mass. Model satellites, however, are systematically redder than in the SDSS, particularly at low mass and around low-mass primaries. Simulated haloes of a given mass have satellite abundances that are independent of central galaxy colour, but red centrals tend to have lower stellar masses, reflecting earlier quenching of star formation by feedback. This explains the correlation between satellite abundance and primary colour in the simulation. The correlation between satellite colour and primary colour arises because red centrals live in haloes which are more massive, older and more gas rich, so that satellite quenching is more efficient.},

abstract = {We use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy–galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z = 0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range m ± dm/2 that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low-mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low-mass galaxies at all redshifts, but also the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low-mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term `assembly bias'. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.},

abstract = {We describe the design and data sample from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, the densest and largest precision-redshift survey of galaxies at z {\~{}} 1 completed to date. The survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massive galaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down to absolute magnitude M{\_}B = -20 at z {\~{}} 1 via {\~{}}90 nights of observation on the DEIMOS spectrograph at Keck Observatory. DEEP2 covers an area of 2.8 deg{\^{}}2 divided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of R{\_}AB=24.1. Objects with z {\textless} 0.7 are rejected based on BRI photometry in three of the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z {\textgreater} 0.7 to be targeted {\~{}}2.5 times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately sixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly 53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the targets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z {\~{}} 1.45. The DEIMOS 1200-line/mm grating used for the survey delivers high spectral resolution (R{\~{}}6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique internal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the DEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into one of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. DEEP2 surpasses other deep precision-redshift surveys at z {\~{}} 1 in terms of galaxy numbers, redshift accuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also provide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far. This paper is intended as a handbook for users of the DEEP2 Data Release 4, which includes all DEEP2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for the publicly-available DEEP2 DEIMOS data reduction pipelines.

abstract = {We use a very large simulation of structure growth in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe - the Millennium Simulation - to study assembly bias, the fact that the large-scale clustering of haloes of given mass varies significantly with their assembly history. We extend earlier work based on the same simulation by superposing results for redshifts from 0 to 3, by defining a less noisy estimator of clustering amplitude, and by considering halo concentration, substructure mass fraction and spin, as well as formation time, as additional parameters. These improvements lead to results with less noise than previous studies and covering a wider range of halo masses and structural properties. We find significant and significantly different assembly bias effects for all the halo properties we consider, although in all cases the dependencies on halo mass and on redshift are adequately described as a dependence on equivalent peak height $\nu$(M, z). The $\nu$-dependencies for different halo properties differ qualitatively and are not related as might naively be expected given the relations between formation time, concentration, substructure fraction and spin found for the halo population as a whole. These results suggest that it will be difficult to build models for the galaxy populations of dark haloes which can robustly relate the amplitude of large-scale galaxy clustering to that for mass clustering at better than the 10 per cent level.},

The telescope is a modified two-corrector Ritchey-Chr{\'{e}}tien design with a 2.5 m, f/2.25 primary, a 1.08 m secondary, a Gascoigne astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 {\AA}) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2*1820{\^{}}3 resolution elements in a (106.5Mpc){\^{}}3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z=0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z=0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star-formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z=7 to z=0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z=4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their halos for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star-formation rates up to z=8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z=5 to z=0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in HST mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z=2 to their z=0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z=0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star-formation activity and compactness.

abstract = {WMAP precision data enables accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated universe seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale CMB measurements and measurements of large scle structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega{\_}b h{\^{}}2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega{\_}m h{\^{}}2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n{\_}s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03, and sigma{\_}8=0.84+-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directly from the TE data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omega{\_}tot = 1.02 +- 0.02, the equation of state of the dark energy w {\textless} -0.78 (95{\%} confidence limit assuming w {\textgreater}= -1), and the energy density in stable neutrinos, Omega{\_}nu h{\^{}}2 {\textless} 0.0076 (95{\%} confidence limit). For 3 degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95{\%} confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.},

abstract = {(abridged) The clustering properties of galaxies belonging to different luminosity ranges or having different morphological types are different. These characteristics or `marks' permit to understand the galaxy catalogs that carry all this information as realizations of marked point processes. Many attempts have been presented to quantify the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on their inner properties. The present paper summarizes methods on spatial marked statistics used in cosmology to disentangle luminosity, colour or morphological segregation and introduces a new one in this context, the mark connection function. The methods used here are the partial correlation functions, including the cross-correlation function, the normalised mark correlation function, the mark variogram and the mark connection function. All these methods are applied to a volume-limited sample drawn from the 2dFGRS, using the spectral type as the mark. We show the virtues of each method to provide information about the clustering properties of each population, the dependence of the clustering on the marks, the similarity of the marks as a function of the pair distances, and the way to characterise the spatial correlation between the marks. We demonstrate by means of these statistics that passive galaxies exhibit stronger spatial correlation than active galaxies at small scales (r {\textless}20 Mpc/h). The mark connection function, introduced here, is particularly useful for understanding the spatial correlation between the marks.},

A total area of 1.22 square degree is covered in five contiguous sub-fields, each of which corresponds to a single Suprime-Cam field of view (34'× 27'), in five broadband filters to the depths of B=28.4, V=27.8, R{\_}c=27.7, i'=27.7, and z'=26.6 (AB, 3-$\sigma$, $\phi$-2arcsec). The data are reduced and compiled into five multi-waveband photometric catalogs, separately for each Suprime-Cam field. The i'-band catalogs contain about 900,000 objects in total, making the SXDS catalogs one of the largest multi-waveband object catalogs in corresponding depth and area coverage. The SXDS catalogs can be used for an extensive range of astronomical applications such as the number density study of the Galactic halo stars to the large scale structures at the distant universe. The number counts of galaxies are derived and compared with those of existing deep extragalactic surveys. Photometric redshifts of galaxies are estimated based on the optical data combined with near-infrared data derived from UKIDSS/UDS survey. The optical data, the source catalogs presented here are publicly available on the SXDS web page (http://www.naoj.org/Science/SubaruProject/SXDS/index.html).},

abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z ˜ 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to 1012.5 M⊙. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z {\textless} 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

abstract = {There has been plenty of observational evidence of cluster galaxy evolution. However, it has been difficult to identify the origin of the cluster galaxy evolution. Here we show that gravitational interaction/friction between galaxies is the statistically dominant physical mechanism responsible for the cluster galaxy evolution, and that the well-favored ram-pressure stripping by the cluster gas is not statistically driving the cluster galaxy evolution. We have constructed the largest composite cluster with 14548 member galaxies out of 335 clusters with {\~{}}{\textgreater}300 km/s carefully selected from the SDSS. By measuring velocity dispersions of various subsamples of galaxies in this composite cluster, we found that bright cluster galaxies (Mz{\textless}-23) have significantly smaller velocity dispersion than faint galaxies (Mz{\textgreater}-23). We interpret this as direct evidence of the dynamical interaction/friction between cluster galaxies, where massive galaxies lose their velocity through the energy equipartition during the dynamical interaction/friction with less massive galaxies. We also found that star-forming late-type galaxies have a larger velocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies. This is inconsistent with the ram-pressure stripping model; since the ram-pressure is proportional to sigma v{\^{}}2 (i.e., stronger for galaxies with high velocity), the ram-pressure stripping cannot explain the observed trends of passive (evolved) galaxies having low velocity rather than high velocity. On the other hand, the result is again consistent with the dynamical galaxy-galaxy interaction/friction, where more evolved (passive) galaxies lose their velocity through dynamical interaction/friction.},

abstract = {Correlations between the star formation rates (SFRs) of nearby galaxies (so-called galactic conformity) have been observed for projected separations up to 4 Mpc, an effect not predicted by current semi-analytic models. We investigate correlations between the mass accretion rates (dMvir/dt) of nearby halos as a potential physical origin for this effect. We find that pairs of host halos "know about" each others' assembly histories even when their present-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either halo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the halos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt. Instead, halo pairs at these distances reside in the same large-scale tidal environment, which regulates dMvir/dt for both halos. Larger halos are less affected by external forces, which naturally gives rise to a mass dependence of the halo conformity signal. SDSS measurements of galactic conformity exhibit a qualitatively similar dependence on stellar mass, including how the signal varies with distance. Based on the expectation that halo accretion and galaxy SFR are correlated, we predict the scale-, mass- and redshift-dependence of large-scale galactic conformity, finding that the signal should drop to undetectable levels by z {\textgreater} 1. These predictions are testable with current surveys to z {\~{}} 1; confirmation would establish a strong correlation between dark matter halo accretion rate and central galaxy SFR.},

This data release consists of 3324 square degrees of five-band (u g r i z) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 degrees of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach a depth of r {\~{}} 22.2 (95{\%} completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2{\%} rms and 100 milli-arcsec rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point spread function (PSF) magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for extended sources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 A to 9200 A at a resolution of 2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars, and has substantially improved spectrophotometry. All data included in the SDSS Early Data Release and First Data Release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines, and included in the Second Data Release.

abstract = {Assembly bias describes the finding that the clustering of dark matter haloes depends on halo formation time at fixed halo mass. In this paper, we analyse the influence of assembly bias on galaxy clustering using both semi-analytical models (SAMs) and observational data. At fixed stellar mass, SAMs predict that the clustering of {\{}$\backslash$it central{\}} galaxies depends on the specific star formation rate (sSFR), with more passive galaxies having a higher clustering amplitude. We find similar trends using SDSS group catalogues, and verify that these are not affected by possible biases due to the group finding algorithm. Low mass central galaxies reside in narrow bins of halo mass, so the observed trends of higher clustering amplitude for galaxies with lower sSFR is not driven by variations of the parent halo mass. We argue that the clustering dependence on sSFR represent a direct detection of assembly bias. In addition, contrary to what expected based on clustering of dark matter haloes, we find that low-mass central galaxies in SAMs with larger host halo mass have a {\{}$\backslash$it lower{\}} clustering amplitude than their counter-parts residing in lower mass haloes. This results from the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, assembly bias has a stronger influence on clustering than the dependence on the parent halo mass.},

abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0 to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z {\textless} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation function w($\theta$) in the COSMOS field. Independent determinations of w($\theta$) as a function of magnitude limit are presented for both the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS catalog and also the ground-based data from Subaru and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Despite having significantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright magnitudes (I AB {\textless} 22), our data generally match very well with existing measurements and with mock catalogs based on the semianalytic galaxy formation calculations of Kitzbichler {\&} White (2007) from the Millennium Simulation, The exception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic variance scatter for $\theta$ {\textgreater} 10′, which we attribute to a particularly rich structure known to exist at z ≃ 0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level of clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies; in all three catalogs we find w($\theta$ = 1′) ≃ 0.014 at a median I AB magnitude of 24. At these very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest determinations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering is approximately double what is predicted by the semianalytic catalogs (at all angles). The semianalytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which is too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the mean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated. {\textcopyright} 2007. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H{\_}2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K{\~{}}18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K{\~{}}21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K{\~{}}23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : this http URL). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

abstract = {We develop a simple yet comprehensive method to distinguish the underlying drivers of galaxy quenching, using the clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing of red and blue galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Building on the {\textless}monospace{\textgreater}iHOD{\textless}/monospace{\textgreater} framework developed by Zu {\&} Mandelbaum, we consider two quenching scenarios: (1) a `halo' quenching model in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in both centrals and satellites; and (2) a `hybrid' quenching model in which the quenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass, while the satellite quenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fitting models describe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching provides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above 1011 h-2 M⊙. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo mass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct weak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which quenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which galaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed M*, fail to reproduce the observed halo mass for massive blue centrals. We find similar critical halo masses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites (˜1.5 × 1012 h-1 M⊙), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism for both, e.g. the virial shock heating of infalling gas. The success of the {\textless}monospace{\textgreater}iHOD{\textless}/monospace{\textgreater} halo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism that quenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of their dark matter haloes rather than the properties of their stellar components.},

abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 $\mu$m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 $\mu$m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 $\mu$m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 $\mu$m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 $\mu$m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 $\mu$m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 ± 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 $\mu$m and of 17 ± 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 $\mu$m (95{\%} confidence). This integrated flux {\~{}}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 $\mu$m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

abstract = {The results of numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering in universes dominated by weakly interacting, 'cold' dark matter are presented. The numerical methods used and the way in which initial conditions were generated are described, and the simulations performed are catalogued. The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

abstract = {We measure the angular clustering of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 in order to probe the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies within their dark matter halos. Specifically, we measure the angular correlation function on very small scales (7-320") in a range of luminosity threshold samples (absolute r-band magnitudes of -18 up to -21) that are constructed from the subset of SDSS that has been spectroscopically observed more than once (the so-called plate overlap region). We choose to measure angular clustering in this reduced survey footprint in order to minimize the effects of fiber collision incompleteness, which are otherwise substantial on these small scales. We model our clustering measurements using a fully numerical halo model that populates dark matter halos in N-body simulations to create realistic mock galaxy catalogs. The model has free parameters that specify both the number and spatial distribution of galaxies within their host halos. We adopt a flexible density profile for the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies that is similar to the dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, except that the inner slope is allowed to vary. We find that the angular clustering of our most luminous samples (Mr{\textless} -20 and -21) suggests that luminous satellite galaxies have substantially steeper inner density profiles than NFW. Lower luminosity samples are less constraining, however, and are consistent with satellite galaxies having shallow density profiles. Our results confirm the findings of Watson et al. 2012 while using different clustering measurements and modeling methodology.},

abstract = {Sizes of galaxies are an important diagnostic for galaxy formation models. In this study I use the abundance matching ansatz, which has proven to be successful in reproducing galaxy clustering and other statistics, to derive estimates of the virial radius, R200, for galaxies of different morphological types and wide range of stellar mass. I show that over eight of orders of magnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an approximately linear relation between 3D half-mass radius of their stellar distribution, rhalf and virial radius, rhalf{\~{}}0.015R200 with a scatter of {\~{}}0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with expectation of models which assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, which implies rhalf$\backslash$propto lambda R200, where lambda is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of {\$}\backslashlambda{\$} and normalization of the relation agrees with that predicted by the model of Mo, Mao {\&} White (1998), if galaxy sizes were set on average at z{\~{}}1-2. Moreover, I show that when stellar and gas surface density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled using radius r{\_}n= 0.015 R200, the rescaled surface density profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) profiles with scatter of only 30-50{\%} at R{\~{}}1-3r{\_}n. Remarkably, both late and early type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R{\textgreater}r{\_}n. The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R{\textless}r{\_}n. The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halo and that sizes of both late type disks and early type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum.},

abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local Universe. We estimate k-corrections, evolution corrections, and stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/Ls) by fitting the galaxy colors with simple models. Our optical and near-infrared luminosity functions agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies, and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate that the true K-band luminosity function has a steeper faint end slope than the direct estimate. Assuming a universally-applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we derive the stellar mass function of galaxies. The faint end slope slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/Ls characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local Universe Omega* h = 0.0020+/-0.0006 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics. Finally, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the Universe is in early-type galaxies. We present also SDSS/2MASS color-M/L correlations, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g and K-band stellar M/Ls as a function of stellar mass.

We find pronounced effects of nongaussianity on the clustering of dark matter halos, leading to strongly scale-dependent bias.

abstract = {We apply updated semi-analytic galaxy formation models simultaneously to the stored halo/subhalo merger trees of the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations. These differ by a factor of 125 in mass resolution, allowing explicit testing of resolution effects on predicted galaxy properties. We have revised the treatments of the transition between the rapid infall and cooling flow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges and of gaseous and stellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central and satellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star stripping once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency and scaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance of low-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9 magnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of Milky Way satellites. This suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solve the "missing satellite" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. The same model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and colour. The fit remains excellent down to {\~{}}30kpc for massive galaxies. For M* {\textless} 6 x 10{\^{}}10Msun, however, the model overpredicts clustering at scales below 1 Mpc, suggesting that the sigma{\_}8 adopted in the simulations (0.9) is too high. Galaxy distributions within rich clusters agree between the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies without dark matter subhalos (so-called orphans) are included. Our model predicts a larger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as an overabundance of {\~{}}10{\^{}}10Msun galaxies beyond z{\~{}}0.6, reflecting deficiencies in the way star-formation rates are modelled.},

abstract = {In this paper, we test the age matching hypothesis that the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy is determined by its dark matter halo formation history, and as such, that more quiescent galaxies reside in older halos. This simple model has been remarkably successful at predicting color-based galaxy statistics at low redshift as measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To further test this method with observations, we present new SDSS measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and SFR, separated into quenched and star forming galaxy samples. We find that our age matching model is in excellent agreement with these new measurements. We also employ a galaxy group finder and show that our model is able to predict: (1) the relative SFRs of central and satellite galaxies, (2) the SFR-dependence of the radial distribution of satellite galaxy populations within galaxy groups, rich groups, and clusters and their surrounding larger scale environments, and (3) the interesting feature that the satellite quenched fraction as a function of projected radial distance from the central galaxy exhibits an {\~{}}r{\^{}}-.15 slope, independent of environment. The accurate prediction for the spatial distribution of satellites is intriguing given the fact that we do not explicitly model satellite-specific processes after infall, and that in our model the virial radius does not mark a special transition region in the evolution of a satellite, contrary to most galaxy evolution models. The success of the model suggests that present-day galaxy SFR is strongly correlated with halo mass assembly history.},

abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat $\Lambda$CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, {\textless}N{\textgreater}M, has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for {\textless}N{\textgreater}M{\textless}{\~{}}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law {\textless}Ns{\textgreater}{\~{}}M$\beta$ with $\beta${\~{}}1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to {\~{}}100 h-1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

We confirm the bimodal color and morphological-type distribution for satellite galaxies at this redshift range: the red and blue classes correspond to the early and late morphological types, respectively, and the early-type satellites are on average brighter than the late-type ones. Furthermore, there is a morphological conformity between the central and satellite galaxies: the fraction of early-type satellites in groups with an early-type central is higher than those with a late-type central galaxy. This effect is stronger at smaller separations from the central galaxy. We find a marginally significant signal of alignment between the major axis of the early-type central galaxy and its satellite system, while for the late-type centrals no significant alignment signal is found.

In contrast to H$\alpha$ measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak H$\alpha$, and where H$\alpha$ is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no H$\alpha$ show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

abstract = {We explore a possible origin for the puzzling anti-correlation between the formation epoch of galactic dark-matter haloes and their environment density. This correlation has been revealed from cosmological N-body simulations and is in conflict with the extended Press-Schechter model of halo clustering. Using similar simulations, we first quantify the straightforward association of an early formation epoch with a reduced mass-growth rate at late times. We then find that a primary driver of suppressed growth, by accretion and mergers, is tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive halo. The tidal effects range from a slowdown of the assembly of haloes due to the shear along the large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to actual mass loss in haloes that pass through the massive halo. Using the restricted three-body problem, we show that haloes are prone to tidal mass loss within 1.5 virial radii of a larger halo. Our results suggest that the dependence of the formation epoch on environment density is a secondary effect induced by the enhanced density of haloes in filaments near massive haloes where the tides are strong. Our measures of assembly rate are particularly correlated with the tidal field at high redshifts z {\~{}} 1.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the quenching properties of galaxies are correlated over several mega-parsecs. The large-scale "galactic conformity" phenomenon around central galaxies has been regarded as a potential signature of "galaxy assembly bias" or "pre-heating", both of which interpret conformity as a result of direct environmental effects acting on galaxy formation. Building on the iHOD halo quenching framework developed in Zu {\&} Mandelbaum (2015, 2016), we discover that our fiducial halo mass quenching model, without any galaxy assembly bias, can successfully explain the overall environmental dependence and the conformity of galaxy colours in SDSS, as measured by the mark correlation functions of galaxy colours and the red galaxy fractions around isolated primaries, respectively. Our fiducial iHOD halo quenching mock also correctly predicts the differences in the spatial clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signals between the more vs. less red galaxy subsamples, split by the red-sequence ridge-line at fixed stellar mass. Meanwhile, models that tie galaxy colours fully or partially to halo assembly bias have difficulties in matching all these observables simultaneously. Therefore, we demonstrate that the observed environmental dependence of galaxy colours can be naturally explained by the combination of 1) halo quenching and 2) the variation of halo mass function with environment --- an indirect environmental effect mediated by two separate physical processes.},

@article{Knobel2015,
abstract = {We re-examine the fraction of low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey satellites and centrals in which star formation has been quenched, using the environment quenching efficiency formalism that separates out the dependence of stellar mass. We show that the centrals of the groups containing the satellites are responding to the environment in the same way as their satellites (at least for stellar masses above 1010.3 M ⊙), and that the well-known differences between satellites and the general set of centrals arise because the latter are overwhelmingly dominated by isolated galaxies. The widespread concept of "satellite quenching" as the cause of environmental effects in the galaxy population can therefore be generalized to "group quenching." We then explore the dependence of the quenching efficiency of satellites on overdensity, group-centric distance, halo mass, the stellar mass of the satellite, and the stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of its central, trying to isolate the effect of these often interdependent variables. We emphasize the importance of the central sSFR in the quenching efficiency of the associated satellites, and develop the meaning of this "galactic conformity" effect in a probabilistic description of the quenching of galaxies. We show that conformity is strong, and that it varies strongly across parameter space. Several arguments then suggest that environmental quenching and mass quenching may be different manifestations of the same underlying process. The marked difference in the apparent mass dependencies of environment quenching and mass quenching which produces distinctive signatures in the mass functions of centrals and satellites will arise naturally, since, for satellites at least, the distributions of the environmental variables that we investigate in this work are essentially independent of the stellar mass of the satellite.},

abstract = {[Abridged] Recent studies revealed a strong correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of star-forming galaxies, the so-called star-forming main sequence. An empirical modeling approach (2-SFM) which distinguishes between the main sequence and rarer starburst galaxies is capable of reproducing most statistical properties of infrared galaxies. In this paper, we extend this approach by establishing a connection between stellar mass and halo mass with the technique of abundance matching. Based on a few, simple assumptions and a physically motivated formalism, our model successfully predicts the (cross-)power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB), the cross-correlation between CIB and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and the correlation functions of bright, resolved infrared galaxies measured by Herschel, Planck, ACT and SPT. We use this model to infer the redshift distribution these observables, as well as the level of correlation between CIB-anisotropies at different wavelengths. We also predict that more than 90{\%} of cosmic star formation activity occurs in halos with masses between 10{\^{}}11.5 and 10{\^{}}13.5 Msun. Taking into account subsequent mass growth of halos, this implies that the majority of stars were initially (at z{\textgreater}3) formed in the progenitors of clusters, then in groups at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}3 and finally in Milky-Way-like halos at z{\textless}0.5. At all redshifts, the dominant contribution to the star formation rate density stems from halos of mass {\~{}}10{\^{}}12 Msun, in which the instantaneous star formation efficiency is maximal ({\~{}}70{\%}). The strong redshift-evolution of SFR in the galaxies that dominate the CIB is thus plausibly driven by increased accretion from the cosmic web onto halos of this characteristic mass scale.

We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z=7 to z=0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z=4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their halos for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star-formation rates up to z=8.

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

abstract = {We present the first comprehensive analysis of the segregation of dark matter subhaloes in their host haloes. Using numerical simulations, we examine the segregation of twelve different subhalo properties with respect to both orbital energy and halo-centric radius (in real space as well as in projection). Subhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome of the inside-out assembly of their host haloes. Since subhaloes that were accreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that have lost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits. Subhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circular velocities at accretion. We demonstrate that part of this segregation is already imprinted in the infall conditions. For massive subhaloes it is subsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radial orbit. The impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the fact that subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. Because of tidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day mass or maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloes on more bound orbits to have smaller spin. There is a weak tendency for subhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the center of their host halo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formation time is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties. We discuss the implications of our results for the segregation of satellite galaxies in galaxy groups and clusters.},

Our selection method is carefully designed with the aid of N-body simulations to avoid groups and clusters. We find that satellites are significantly more likely to be quenched than a stellar mass-matched sample of isolated galaxies. Remarkably, this quenching occurs only for satellites of hosts that are themselves quenched: while star formation is unaffected in the satellites of star-forming hosts, satellites around quiescent hosts are more than twice as likely to be quenched than stellar-mass matched field samples. One implication of this is that whatever shuts down star formation in isolated, passive L* galaxies also plays at least an indirect role in quenching star formation in their bright satellites. The previously-reported tendency for "galactic conformity" in color/morphology may be a by-product of this host-specific quenching dichotomy. The S$\backslash$'ersic indices of quenched satellites are statistically identical to those of field galaxies with the same specific star formation rates, suggesting that environmental and secular quenching give rise to the same morphological structure. By studying the distribution of pairwise velocities between the hosts and satellites, we find dynamical evidence that passive host galaxies reside in dark matter halos that are {\~{}}45{\%} more massive than those of star-forming host galaxies of the same stellar mass. We emphasize that even around passive hosts, the mere fact that galaxies become satellites does not typically result in star formation quenching: we find that only {\~{}}30{\%} of {\~{}}0.1 L* galaxies that fall in from the field are quenched around passive hosts, compared with {\~{}}0{\%} around star forming hosts.},

abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the SDSS, we investigate the correlation between various galaxy properties and halo mass. We split the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediate types, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed luminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. Most importantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire mass range probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. We argue that the previous claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an artefact of the environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity dependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends more strongly on halo mass than on luminosity. We also find that the early type fraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. Contrary to previous studies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low mass haloes. The properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with those of their central galaxy. In particular, the early type fraction of satellites is significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in a halo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. This phenomenon, which we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for satellites of all luminosities. Finally, the fraction of intermediate type galaxies is always {\~{}}20 percent, independent of luminosity, independent of halo mass, independent of halo-centric radius, and independent of whether the galaxy is a central galaxy or a satellite galaxy. We discuss the implications of all these findings for galaxy formation and evolution.},

@article{Seljak1996,
abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

abstract = {We use a high-resolution {\$}N{\$}-body simulation to study how the formation of cold dark matter (CDM) halos is affected by their environments, and how such environmental effects produce the age-dependence of halo clustering observed in recent {\$}N{\$}-body simulations. We estimate, for each halo selected at redshift {\$}z=0{\$}, an `initial' mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm i{\}}{\$} defined to be the mass enclosed by the largest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the halo particles and within which the mean linear density is equal to the critical value for spherical collapse at {\$}z=0{\$}. For halos of a given final mass, {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}{\$}, the ratio {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm i{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}{\$} has large scatter, and the scatter is larger for halos of lower final masses. Halos that form earlier on average have larger {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm i{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm h{\}}{\$}, and so correspond to higher peaks in the initial density field than their final masses imply. Old halos are more strongly clustered than younger ones of the same mass because their initial masses are larger. The age-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due to the difference in the initial/final mass ratio. Low-mass old halos are almost always located in the vicinity of big structures, and their old ages are largely due to the fact that their mass accretions are suppressed by the hot environments produced by the tidal fields of the larger structure. The age-dependence of clustering is weaker for more massive halos because the heating by large-scale tidal fields is less important.},

abstract = {We develop an empirical approach to infer the star formation rate in dark matter haloes from the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at different redshifts and the local cluster galaxy luminosity function (CGLF), which has a steeper faint end relative to the SMF of local galaxies. As satellites are typically old galaxies which have been accreted earlier, this feature can cast important constraint on the formation of low-mass galaxies at high redshift. The evolution of the SMFs suggests the star formation in high-mass haloes ({\textgreater}1012 h-1 M⊙) has to be boosted at high redshift beyond what is expected from a simple scaling of the dynamical time. The faint end of the CGLF implies a characteristic redshift zc ≈ 2 above which the star formation rate in low-mass haloes with masses {\textless}1011 h-1 M⊙ must be enhanced relative to that at lower z. This is not directly expected from the standard stellar feedback models. Also, this enhancement leads to some interesting predictions, for instance, a significant old stellar population in present-day dwarf galaxies with M⋆ ≤ 108 h-2 M⊙ and steep slopes of high-redshift stellar mass and star formation rate functions.},

abstract = {We have compiled a large sample of isolated central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which do not have a neighbour of comparable brightness within a projected distance of 1 Mpc. We use the colours, luminosities and surface brightnesses of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of these objects to estimate their atomic gas content and to derive the average total mass of HI gas contained in satellites as a function of projected radius from the primary. Recent calibrations of merging timescales from N-body simulations are used to estimate the rate at which this gas will accrete onto the primaries. Our estimated accretion rates fall short of those needed to maintain the observed level of star formation in these systems by nearly two orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, there are strong correlations between the total mass of gas in satellites and the colours and specific star formation rates of central galaxies of all stellar masses. The correlations are much weaker if we consider the total stellar mass in the satellites, rather than their total gas mass. We ask why star formation in the central galaxies should be correlated with gas contained in satellites at projected separations of a Mpc or more, well outside the virial radius of the dark matter halos of these systems. We suggest that gas-rich satellites trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that is accreted continuously, and that provides the fuel for ongoing star formation in galaxies in the local Universe.},

abstract = {The 2367 galaxies in the Nearby Galaxies Catalog (Tully, 1987) have been assigned to clouds, associations, and groups. The group assignments follow from a dendogram analysis with linkages based on an estimator of the gravitational force between entities. The procedure naturally accounts for the effects of tides. Groups are defined by a specific density threshold. Within the radius of reasonable completion of 25/h75 Mpc, 179 groups have been identified that include 69 percent of the known galaxies and 77 percent of the light. An additional 20 percent of the galaxies are in associations, and 10 percent of the galaxies are at-large in clouds. Less than 1 percent of galaxies are by themselves outside of clouds. Evidence is presented that the groups are collapsed and that many should be virialized. There is no indication of a serious interloper problem. The properties of the 49 groups with five or more members show less scatter than was the case with previously identified groups. The median virial radius is 340/h75 kpc, the median velocity dispersion is 100 km/s, and the median value of M(V)/L(B)(b, i) is 94h75 (solar mass)/(solar luminosity).},

Even with a broad search in parameter space the whole model family fails to match to constraining data. In the best fitting models, the star formation and feedback parameters in low-mass haloes are tightly constrained by the two data sets, and the analysis reveals several generic failures of models that similarly apply to other existing SAMs. First, based on the assumption that baryon accretion follows the dark matter accretion, large mass-loading factors are required for haloes with circular velocities lower than 200 km/s, and most of the wind mass must be expelled from the haloes. Second, assuming that the feedback is powered by Type-II supernovae with a Chabrier IMF, the outflow requires more than 25{\%} of the available SN kinetic energy. Finally, the posterior predictive distributions for the star formation history are dramatically inconsistent with observations for masses similar to or smaller than the Milky-Way mass. The inferences suggest that the current model family is still missing some key physical processes that regulate the gas accretion and star formation in galaxies with masses below that of the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Aims.We study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar mass at redshifts z ∼ [0.2'1], using the first 10K redshifts from the zCOSMOS spectroscopic survey of the COSMOS field. Methods. We measured the redshift-space correlation functions $\epsilon$(rp, $\pi$) and $\epsilon$(s) and the projected function, wp(rp) for subsamples covering different luminosity, mass, and redshift ranges. We explored and quantified in detail the observational selection biases from the flux-limited nature of the survey, using ensembles of realistic semi-analytic mock samples built from the Millennium simulation. We used the same mock data sets to carefully check our covariance and error estimate techniques, comparing the performances of methods based on the scatter in the mocks and on bootstrapping schemes. We finally compared our measurements to the cosmological model predictions from the mock surveys. Results. At odds with other measurements at similar redshift and in the local Universe, we find a weak dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity in all three redshift bins explored. A mild dependence on stellar mass is instead observed, in particular on small scales, which becomes particularly evident in the central redshift bin (0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8), where wp(rp) shows strong excess power on scales {\textgreater}1 h-1 Mpc. This is reflected in the shape of the full $\epsilon$(rp, p) that we interpret as produced by dominating structures almost perpendicular to the line of sight in the survey volume. Comparing to z ∼ 0 measurements, we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of the amplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies. Conclusions.This is consistent with previous results and the standard picture in which the bias evolves more rapidly for the most massive haloes, which in turn host the highest-stellar-mass galaxies. At the same time, however, the clustering measured in the zCOSMOS 10K data at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 for galaxies with log(M/M) ≥ 10 is only marginally consistent with the predictions from the mock surveys. On scales larger than ∼2 h -1 Mpc, the observed clustering amplitude is compatible only with ∼1{\%} of the mocks. Thus, if the power spectrum of matter is $\Delta$CDM with standard normalisation and the bias has no unnatural scale-dependence, this result indicates that COSMOS has picked up a particularly rare, ∼2'3$\sigma$ positive fluctuation in a volume of ∼106 h-1 Mpc 3. These findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z ∼ 1 Universe to appropriately characterise the level of structure at this epoch. {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

abstract = {We use a very large simulation of the concordance LCDM cosmogony to study the clustering of dark matter haloes. For haloes less massive than about 1e13Msun/h, the amplitude of the two-point correlation function on large scales depends strongly on halo formation time. Haloes that assembled at high redshift are substantially more clustered than those that assembled more recently. The effect is a smooth function of halo formation time and its amplitude increases with decreasing halo mass. At 1e11 Msun/h the ``oldest'' 10{\%} of haloes are more than 5 times more strongly correlated than the ``youngest'' 10{\%}. This unexpected result is incompatible with the standard excursion set theory for structure growth, and it contradicts a fundamental assumption of the halo occupation distribution models often used to study galaxy clustering, namely that the galaxy content of a halo of given mass is statistically independent of its larger scale environment.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 Ks -selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50{\%}, 10{\%}, and 1{\%} of its current value at z {\~{}} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as $\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-4.7 ± 0.4 since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as $\rho$starvprop(1 + z)-2.3 ± 0.2. At z {\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M star/M ⊙) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(M star/M ⊙) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater}1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.

We use two large volume, high-resolution N-body simulations to study how the correlation function of massive dark matter halos depends upon their mass and formation history. We find that halos with the lowest concentrations are presently more clustered than those of higher concentration, the size of the effect increasing with halo mass; this agrees with trends found in studies of lower mass halos. The clustering dependence on other characterizations of the full mass accretion history appears weaker than the effect with concentration. Using the integrated correlation function, marked correlation functions, and a power-law fit to the correlation function, we find evidence that halos which have recently undergone a major merger or a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering relative to a randomly chosen population with the same mass distribution.},

We find 231 groups above the number overdensity threshold delta(rho)/rho=80 in the redshift range 5000{\textless}cz {\textless}60000 km/s. These groups contain 1250 members, 40.5{\%} of the 3085 ESP galaxies within the same redshift range. The median velocity dispersion (corrected for measurement errors and computed at the redshift of the group) is sigmaESP,median = 194 km/s. We show that our result is reliable in spite of the particular geometry of the ESP survey (two rows of tangent circular fields of radius 15 arcmin), which causes most systems to be only partially surveyed. In general, we find that the properties of ESP groups are consistent with those of groups in shallower (and wider) catalogs (e.g. CfA2N and SSRS2). As in shallower catalogs, ESP groups trace very well the geometry of the large scale structure. Our results are of particular interest because the depth of the ESP survey allows us to sample group properties over a large number of structures. We also compare luminosity function and spectral properties of galaxies that are members of groups with those of isolated galaxies. We find that galaxies in groups have a brighter M with respect to non-member galaxies; the slope alpha is the same, within the errors, in the two cases. We find that 34{\%} of ESP galaxies with detectable emission lines are members of groups. The fraction of galaxies without detectable emission lines in groups is significantly higher: 45{\%}. More generally, we find a gradual decrease of the fraction of emission line galaxies among members of systems of increasing richness. This result confirms that the morphology-density relation found for clusters also extends toward systems of lower density.},

abstract = {We investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on halo formation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number, using high-resolution numerical simulations of a LCDM cosmology. We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(c,M|z) = b(M|z) b(c|M/M*). The scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M {\textless}{\~{}} M* while low concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M {\textgreater}{\~{}} M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clustered counterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

abstract = {We investigate the mass loss of galaxies in groups and clusters with high-resolution DM simulations. We detect weak mass segregation in the inner regions of group/cluster haloes, consistent with observational findings. This applies to samples of galaxy analogues selected using either their present-day mass or past maximum (peak) mass. We find a strong radial trend in the fractional mass lost by the galaxies since peak, independent of their mass. This suggests that segregation is due to massive galaxies having formed closer to the halo centres and not the preferential destruction of smaller galaxies near halo centres. We divide our sample into galaxies that were accreted as a group vs. as a single, distinct halo. We find strong evidence for preprocessing -- the grouped galaxies lose {\$}\backslashsim 35-45\backslash{\%}{\$} of their peak mass before being accreted onto their final host haloes, compared to single galaxies which lose {\$}\backslashsim12\backslash{\%}{\$}. After accretion, however, the single galaxies lose more mass compared to the grouped ones. These results are consistent with a scenario in which grouped galaxies are preprocessed in smaller haloes while single galaxies `catch up' in terms of total mass loss once they are accreted onto the final host halo. The fractional mass loss is mostly independent of the galaxy mass and host mass, and increases with amount of time spent in a dense environment.},

abstract = {The age matching model has recently been shown to predict correctly the luminosity L and g-r color of galaxies residing within dark matter halos. The central tenet of the model is intuitive: older halos tend to host galaxies with older stellar populations. In this paper, we demonstrate that age matching also correctly predicts the g-r color trends exhibited in a wide variety of statistics of the galaxy distribution for stellar mass M* threshold samples. In particular, we present new measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal as a function of M* and g-r color from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and show that age matching exhibits remarkable agreement with these and other statistics of low-redshift galaxies. In so doing, we also demonstrate good agreement between the galaxy-galaxy lensing observed by SDSS and the signal predicted by abundance matching, a new success of this model. We describe how age matching is a specific example of a larger class of Conditional Abundance Matching models (CAM), a theoretical framework we introduce here for the first time. CAM provides a general formalism to study correlations at fixed mass between any galaxy property and any halo property. The striking success of our simple implementation of CAM provides compelling evidence that this technique has the potential to describe the same set of data as alternative models, but with a dramatic reduction in the required number of parameters. CAM achieves this reduction by exploiting the capability of contemporary N-body simulations to determine dark matter halo properties other than mass alone, which distinguishes our model from conventional approaches to the galaxy-halo connection.},

For a sequence of cosmological models with a fixed P(k) shape and increasing normalization $\backslash$sig8, we find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that reproduce SDSS measurements of w(rp) as a function of luminosity. Using these HOD models we calculate mean M/L ratios as a function of halo mass and populate halos of N-body simulations to compute M/L in larger scale environments, including cluster infall regions. For all cosmological models, the M/L ratio in high mass halos or high density regions is approximately independent of halo mass or smoothing scale. However, the "plateau" value of M/L depends on $\backslash$sig8 as well as $\backslash$Omega{\_}m, and it represents the universal mass-to-light ratio {\textless}M/L{\textgreater} only for models in which the galaxy correlation function is approximately unbiased, i.e., with $\backslash$sig8 {\~{}} $\backslash$sig8{\_}gal.

Above the charac-teristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minus four-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off at an average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. By comparison, the shape and normalization of the efficiency change very little since z = 4. We show that a time-independent star forma-tion efficiency simply explains the shape of the cosmic star formation rate since z = 4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates. The rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z = 2 is especially sensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. The mass dependence of the efficiency strongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result that two-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor of three of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the Milky Way.},

The instrument will be used to carry out photometry essentially simultaneously in five color bands spanning the range accessible to silicon detectors on the ground in the time-delay- and-integrate (TDI) scanning mode. The photometric detectors are arrayed in the focal plane in six columns of five chips each such that two scans cover a filled stripe 2.5 degrees wide.

@article{Bray2016,
abstract = {Comparisons between observational surveys and galaxy formation models find that the mass of dark matter haloes can largely explain galaxies' stellar mass. However, it remains uncertain whether additional environmental variables, generally referred to as assembly bias, are necessary to explain other galaxy properties. We use the Illustris Simulation to investigate the role of assembly bias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18,000 galaxies with {\$}M{\_}{\{}stellar{\}}{\$} {\textgreater} {\$}2 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}9{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. We find a significant signal of galactic conformity: out to distances of about 10 Mpc, the mean red fraction of galaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, in which the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higher around old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. A plausible interpretation of galactic conformity can be given as a combination of the halo conformity signal with the galaxy color-halo age relation: at fixed stellar mass, particularly toward the low-mass end, Illustris' galaxy colors correlate with halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) being preferentially found in the oldest haloes. In fact, we can explain the galactic conformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, by assigning stellar mass based on halo mass (abundance matching) and by assigning galaxy color based on halo age (age matching). We investigate other interpretations for the galactic conformity, particularly its dependence on the isolation criterion and on the central-satellite information. Regarding comparison to observations, we conclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, and stacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude of the conformity signal.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of {\~{}} 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z {\textless} 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* {\textgreater} 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions out to {\$}z \backslashsim 4{\$}, the conditional stellar mass function at {\$}z\backslashsim 0.1{\$} obtained from SDSS galaxy group catalogues, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at {\$}z \backslashsim 0.1{\$} as function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from {\$}z \backslashsim 4{\$} to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-{\$}z{\$} galaxies as function of stellar mass. Our main findings are the following: (i) Our model reasonably fits all data within the observational uncertainties, indicating that the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM concordance cosmology is consistent with a wide variety of data regarding the galaxy population across cosmic time.

abstract = {We examine the star formation properties of bright ({\~{}}0.1 L*) satellites around isolated {\~{}}L* hosts in the local Universe using spectroscopically confirmed systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Our selection method is carefully designed with the aid of N-body simulations to avoid groups and clusters. We find that satellites are significantly more likely to be quenched than a stellar mass-matched sample of isolated galaxies. Remarkably, this quenching occurs only for satellites of hosts that are themselves quenched: while star formation is unaffected in the satellites of star-forming hosts, satellites around quiescent hosts are more than twice as likely to be quenched than stellar-mass matched field samples. One implication of this is that whatever shuts down star formation in isolated, passive L* galaxies also plays at least an indirect role in quenching star formation in their bright satellites. The previously-reported tendency for "galactic conformity" in color/morphology may be a by-product of this host-specific quenching dichotomy. The S$\backslash$'ersic indices of quenched satellites are statistically identical to those of field galaxies with the same specific star formation rates, suggesting that environmental and secular quenching give rise to the same morphological structure. By studying the distribution of pairwise velocities between the hosts and satellites, we find dynamical evidence that passive host galaxies reside in dark matter halos that are {\~{}}45{\%} more massive than those of star-forming host galaxies of the same stellar mass. We emphasize that even around passive hosts, the mere fact that galaxies become satellites does not typically result in star formation quenching: we find that only {\~{}}30{\%} of {\~{}}0.1 L* galaxies that fall in from the field are quenched around passive hosts, compared with {\~{}}0{\%} around star forming hosts.},

Satellites for both star-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractions compared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. We also observe "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are more likely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals. In our sample, this conformity signal is significant at {\$}\backslashgtrsim3\backslashsigma{\$} for {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}1.6{\$}, whereas it is only weakly significant at {\$}0.3{\textless}z{\textless}0.6{\$} and {\$}1.6{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$}. Therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has been present for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. The satellite quenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, but does not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the mass limit of our sample. When we compare the satellite quenching efficiency of star-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescent centrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformity signal decreases, but remains statistically significant at {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$}. This is evidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation properties of the central as well as to the mass of the halo. We discuss physical effects that may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allow for continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites are quenched.},

The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z=0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star-formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z=7 to z=0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z=4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their halos for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star-formation rates up to z=8.

abstract = {Using a sample of 19,464 galaxies drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.35. We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends strongly on local environment out to z {\textgreater} 1, being larger in regions of greater galaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red, morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured overdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local overdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z {\textgreater} 1 detected at a greater than 5-$\backslash$sigma level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find that the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more strongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence counterparts at high redshift. At z {\~{}} 1.3, the red fraction only weakly correlates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to the clustering of {\~{}} L* galaxies at that epoch must be small. Our findings add weight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence has occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) at z {\textless} 1.5. The strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.35 suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-density and color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms (i.e., "nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by "nature'') upon the galaxy population during their epoch of formation.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11663 deg{\^{}}2 of imaging data, with most of the roughly 2000 deg{\^{}}2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry over 250 deg{\^{}}2 along the Celestial Equator in the Southern Galactic Cap. A coaddition of these data goes roughly two magnitudes fainter than the main survey. The spectroscopy is now complete over a contiguous area of 7500 deg{\^{}}2 in the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC-2), reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milli-arcseconds per coordinate. A systematic error in bright galaxy photometr is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat-fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.

abstract = {The relationship between galaxies and dark matter (DM) can be characterized by the halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that are satellites. Here, we present observational constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on these quantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6 × 1010Msolar is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4 × 1012h-1Msolar, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of 17+10-5 per cent (early-types) and 16+15-6 per cent (late-types) at the 95 per cent confidence level (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due to assumption of a universal initial mass function). We find that for a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below Mstellar = 1011Msolar, in contrast to typically a factor of 2 difference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early- and late-types become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster haloes with masses above 1013Msolar host ellipticals at the centre, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by haloes of mass below 1013Msolar. We find that the fraction of spirals that are satellites is roughly 10-15 per cent independent of stellar mass or luminosity, while for ellipticals this fraction decreases with stellar mass from 50 per cent at 1010Msolar to 10 per cent at 3 × 1011Msolar or 20 per cent at the maximum luminosity considered. We split the elliptical sample by local density, and find that at a given luminosity there is no difference in the signal on scales below 100h-1kpc between high- and low-density regions, suggesting that tidal stripping inside large haloes does not remove most of the DM from the early-type satellites. This result is dominated by haloes in the mass range 1013-1014h-1Msolar, and is an average over all separations from the group or cluster centre.},

abstract = {We study the correlation between the specific star formation rate of central galaxies and neighbour galaxies, also known as 'galactic conformity', out to several Mpc scales using three different semi-analytic models (SAMs). It has been suggested that SAMs may not show the strong signal of conformity measured in observations. In all the models, when the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in real space, we measure a strong galactic conformity where the mean quenched fraction around quenched primary galaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same stellar mass. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratio, which is used to evaluate the significance and extension in distance of conformity, depends strongly on the SAM. The two-halo conformity is significant as far as {\~{}}5 Mpc/h. The overall signal of galactic conformity decreases when we remove satellites in the selection of primary galaxies. In this case, there is no significant two-halo conformity in two SAMs. For the other SAM, the two-halo conformity is only detected between isolated, central galaxies in relatively low-mass haloes ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm halo{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}12.4{\}}{\$} {\$}h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\~{}}\backslashrm{\{} M{\_}{\{}\backslashbigodot{\}}{\}}{\$}) and their neighbours. Finally, we explore the case when the secondary galaxies correspond to central galaxies in the SAMs as an attempt to measure the conformity between distinct haloes. Our results show that there is no conformity beyond {\~{}}3 Mpc/h. The conformity measured out to scales of 3{\$}-{\$}4 Mpc/h can be related to the environmental influence of large galaxy clusters around near central galaxies.},

abstract = {The large-scale distribution of groups of galaxies selected from complete slices of the CfA redshift survey extension is examined. The survey is used to reexamine the contribution of group members to the galaxy correlation function. The relationship between the correlation function for groups and those calculated for rich clusters is discussed, and the results for groups are examined as an extension of the relation between correlation function amplitude and richness. The group correlation function indicates that groups and individual galaxies are equivalent tracers of the large-scale matter distribution. The distribution of group centers is equivalent to random sampling of the galaxy distribution. The amplitude of the correlation function for groups is consistent with an extrapolation of the amplitude-richness relation for clusters. The amplitude scaled by the mean intersystem separation is also consistent with results for richer clusters.},

abstract = {We have studied the radial distribution of the early (E/S0) and late (S/Irr) types of satellites around bright host galaxies. We made a volume-limited sample of 4986 satellites brighter than Mr = -18.0 associated with 2254 hosts brighter than Mr = -19.0 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 sample. The morphology of satellites is determined by an automated morphology classifier, but the host galaxies are visually classified. We found segregation of satellite morphology as a function of the projected distance from the host galaxy. The amplitude and shape of the early-type satellite fraction profile are found to depend on the host luminosity. This is the morphology-radius/density relation at the galactic scale. There is a strong tendency for morphology conformity between the host galaxy and its satellites. The early-type fraction of satellites hosted by early-type galaxies is systematically larger than that of late-type hosts, and is a strong function of the distance from the host galaxies. Fainter satellites are more vulnerable to the morphology transformation effects of hosts. Dependence of satellite morphology on the large-scale background density was detected. The fraction of early-type satellites increases in high-density regions for both early- and late-type hosts. It is argued that the conformity in morphology of galactic satellite system is mainly originated by the hydrodynamical and radiative effects of hosts on satellites.},

Thus, within the last 4-5 billion years, galaxies in clusters underwent strong evolution that completely changed their character. By contrast, galaxies that are not associated with clusters show far less morphological evolution8. Here we propose that multiple highspeed encounters between galaxies-'galaxy harassment'- drives the morphological evolution in clusters. Our simulations show that these encounters are very different from mergers; they transform small disk galaxies into dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Harassment will leave detectable debris arcs and could provide fuel for quasars in sub-luminous host galaxies.},

abstract = {We present age distribution matching, a theoretical formalism for predicting how galaxies of luminosity L and color C occupy dark matter halos. Our model supposes that there are just two fundamental properties of a halo that determine the color and brightness of the galaxy it hosts: the maximum circular velocity Vmax, and the redshift z{\_}starve that correlates with the epoch at which the star formation in the galaxy ceases. The halo property z{\_}starve is intended to encompass physical characteristics of halo mass assembly that may deprive the galaxy of its cold gas supply and, ultimately, quench its star formation. The new, defining feature of the model is that, at fixed luminosity, galaxy color is in monotonic correspondence with z{\_}starve, with the larger values of z{\_}starve being assigned redder colors. We populate an N- body simulation with a mock galaxy catalog based on age distribution matching, and show that the resulting mock galaxy distribution accurately describes a variety of galaxy statistics. Our model suggests that halo and galaxy assembly are indeed correlated. We make publicly available our low-redshift, SDSS M{\_}r {\textless}-19 mock galaxy catalog, and main progenitor histories of all z=0 halos, at http://logrus.uchicago.edu/{\~{}}aphearin},

abstract = {We present a new high-resolution N-body algorithm for cosmological simulations. The algorithm employs a traditional particle-mesh technique on a cubic grid and successive multilevel relaxations on the finer meshes, introduced recursively in a fully adaptive manner in the regions where the density exceeds a predefined threshold. The mesh is generated to effectively match an arbitrary geometry of the underlying density field -- a property particularly important for cosmological simulations. In a simulation the mesh structure is not created at every time step but is properly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution. The algorithm is fast and effectively parallel. We present a detailed description of the methodology, implementation, and tests of the code. We further use the code to study the structure of dark matter halos in high-resolution (2/h kpc) simulations of standard CDM (Omega=1, h=0.5, sigma{\_}8=0.63) and LCDM (Omega{\_}Lambda=1-Omega{\_}0=0.7, h=0.7, sigma{\_}8=1.0) models. We find that halo density profiles in both CDM and LCDM models are well fitted by the analytical model presented recently by Navarro et al., which predicts a singular [{\$}\backslashrho(r)\backslashpropto r{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}] behavior of the halo density profiles at small radii. We therefore conclude that halos formed in the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model have structure similar to CDM halos and thus cannot explain the dynamics of the central parts of dwarf spiral galaxies, as inferred from the galaxies' rotation curves.},

abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r{\textless}=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses $\mu$50{\textless}=24.5 mag arcsec-2. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small ({\~{}}0.1{\%}), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99{\%}, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N{\textgreater}4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9{\%}) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s-1). About 6{\%} of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55" minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

abstract = {We re-examine the observational evidence for large-scale (4 Mpc) galactic conformity in the local Universe, as presented in Kauffmann et al. (2013). We show that a number of methodological features of their analysis act to produce a misleadingly high amplitude of the conformity signal. These include a weighting in favour of central galaxies in very high-density regions, the likely misclassification of satellite galaxies as centrals in the same high-density regions, and the use of medians to characterize bimodal distributions. We show that the large-scale conformity signal in Kauffmann et al. clearly originates from a very small number of central galaxies in the vicinity of just a few very massive clusters, whose effect is strongly amplified by the methodological issues that we have identified. Some of these 'centrals' are likely misclassified satellites, but some may be genuine centrals showing a real conformity effect. Regardless, this analysis suggests that conformity on 4 Mpc scales is best viewed as a relatively short-range effect (at the virial radius) associated with these very large neighbouring haloes, rather than a very long-range effect (at tens of virial radii) associated with the relatively low-mass haloes that host the nominal central galaxies in the analysis. A mock catalogue constructed from a recent semi-analytic model shows very similar conformity effects to the data when analysed in the same way, suggesting that there is no need to introduce new physical processes to explain galactic conformity on 4 Mpc scales.},

abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of the substructure properties of a single Milky Way sized dark matter halo from the Aquarius suite at five different resolutions, as identified by a variety of different (sub-)halo finders for simulations of cosmic structure formation. These finders span a wide range of techniques and methodologies to extract and quantify substructures within a larger non-homogeneous background density (e.g. a host halo). This includes real-space, phase-space, velocity-space and time- space based finders, as well as finders employing a Voronoi tessellation, friends-of-friends techniques, or refined meshes as the starting point for locating substructure.A common post-processing pipeline was used to uniformly analyse the particle lists provided by each finder. We extract quantitative and comparable measures for the subhaloes, primarily focusing on mass and the peak of the rotation curve for this particular study. We find that all of the finders agree extremely well on the presence and location of substructure and even for properties relating to the inner part part of the subhalo (e.g. the maximum value of the rotation curve). For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the subhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that basic properties (mass, maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably recovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence can be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20. We finally note that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is remarkably consistent and {\textless}1 for all the finders that reached high resolution. If correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively, substructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of the (sub-)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.},

Based on the application domain, we classify and discuss these solutions under five different categories: smart wearable, smart home, smart, city, smart environment, and smart enterprise. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and conceptual framework for future research in the IoT and to motivate and inspire further developments.

abstract = {The flavor and taste of coffee are the most important criteria for evaluating its quality and they are influenced by environmental as well as genetic factors. Because of these factors, including soil, climate and species, diverse components of coffee have been developed. To observe the variation of coffee components by region, a metabolomic approach was applied. In this study, 21 coffee samples of different origin were analyzed by various measuring devices. The acquired data was then integrated and processed by principal component analysis (PCA) using SAS 9.1 software. We found that we could successfully identify the origins of the coffee, dividing the samples in the regions of Asia, South America, and Africa, using the integrated metabolomic approach of combining diverse analytical data with multivariate analysis. In particular, the enhancement of subtle differences by combining data from several instruments resulted in the accurate discrimination of coffee origins. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic sample to constrain the projected radial distribution of satellites around isolated {\~{}} L * galaxies. We employ mock galaxy catalogs derived from high-resolution cosmological simulations to investigate the effects of interloper contamination and show that interlopers significantly bias the estimated slope of the projected radial distribution of satellites. We also show that the distribution of interlopers around galaxies is expected to be nonuniform in velocity space because galaxies are clustered and reside in crowded environments. Successful methods of interloper contamination correction should therefore take into account environments of the host galaxies. Two such new methods are presented, and the most reliable of them is used to correct for interloper contamination in analyses of the SDSS galaxy sample.

abstract = {We develop a simple yet comprehensive method to distinguish the underlying drivers of galaxy quenching, using the clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing of red and blue galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Building on the {\textless}monospace{\textgreater}iHOD{\textless}/monospace{\textgreater} framework developed by Zu {\&} Mandelbaum, we consider two quenching scenarios: (1) a `halo' quenching model in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in both centrals and satellites; and (2) a `hybrid' quenching model in which the quenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass, while the satellite quenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fitting models describe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching provides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above 1011 h-2 M⊙. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo mass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct weak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which quenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which galaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed M*, fail to reproduce the observed halo mass for massive blue centrals. We find similar critical halo masses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites (˜1.5 × 1012 h-1 M⊙), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism for both, e.g. the virial shock heating of infalling gas. The success of the {\textless}monospace{\textgreater}iHOD{\textless}/monospace{\textgreater} halo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism that quenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of their dark matter haloes rather than the properties of their stellar components.},

abstract = {We use a series of N-body simulations of the LCDM cosmology to investigate the redshift evolution since z=1 of the properties and alignment with the large-scale structure of haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids. We find that: (i) Once a rescaling of the halo mass with M*, the mass scale collapsing at redshift z, is performed, there is no further significant redshift dependence in the halo properties; (ii) The environment influences halo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with masses M{\textless}M*; and (iii) There is a significant alignment of both spin and shape of haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a) Haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*, halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M{\textgreater}M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters; c) Haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane independent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M{\textless}M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and haloes with M{\textgreater}M* perpendicular to it. For masses M{\textgreater}M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass scale M* sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS-environment either begins to affect, or reverses, the properties of dark matter haloes.},

abstract = {We report the first results from the Z -FOURGE survey: the discovery of a candidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensities with red galaxies detected at {\textgreater}{\~{}} 20$\sigma$ above the mean surface density. The discovery was made possible by a new deep (Ks {\textless}{\~{}} 24.8 AB 5$\sigma$) Magellan/FOURSTAR near-IR imaging survey with five custom medium-bandwidth filters. The filters pinpoint the location of the Balmer/4000 {\AA} break in evolved stellar populations at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5, yielding significantly more accurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. The overdensities are within 1' of each other in the COSMOS field and appear to be embedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additional overdensity ({\~{}}10$\sigma$). Considering the global properties of the overdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of a galaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. A comparison to a large $\Lambda$CDM simulation suggests that the system may consist of merging subclusters, with properties in between those of z {\textgreater} 2 protoclusters with more diffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusters with prominent red sequences. The structure is completely absent in public optical catalogs in COSMOS and only weakly visible in a shallower near-IR survey. The discovery showcases the potential of deep near-IR surveys with medium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxy evolution at z {\textgreater} 1.5. This Letter includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

abstract = {(Abridged) Using data from the 2dFGRS we compute the conditional luminosity functions (CLFs) of early- and late-type galaxies. These functions give the average number of galaxies with luminosity L that reside in a halo of mass M, and are a powerful statistical tool to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. We find that the average mass-to-light ratios of dark matter haloes have a minimum of about 100 Msun/Lsun around a halo mass of about 3x10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} Msun. In addition, haloes with M {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} Msun are virtually devoid of galaxies, while clusters have b{\_}J band mass-to-light ratios in the range 500-1000 Msun/Lsun. Finally, the fact that early-type galaxies are more strongly clustered than late-type galaxies requires that the fraction of late-type galaxies is a strongly declining function of halo mass. We also compute two-point correlation functions as function of both luminosity and galaxy type, and find a weak (strong) luminosity dependence for the late (early) type galaxies. Finally we compare our CLFs with predictions from several semi-analytical models for galaxy formation. As long as these models accurately fit the 2dFGRS luminosity function the agreement with our predictions is remarkably good. This indicates that we have recovered a statistical description of how galaxies populate dark matter haloes which fits nicely within the standard framework for galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We study the optical colors of 147,920 galaxies brighter than g*=21, observed in five bands by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over {\~{}}100 deg2 of high Galactic latitude sky along the celestial equator. The distribution of galaxies in the g*-r* versus u*-g* color-color diagram is strongly bimodal, with an optimal color separator of u*-r*=2.22. We use visual morphology and spectral classification of subsamples of 287 and 500 galaxies, respectively, to show that the two peaks correspond roughly to early- (E, S0, and Sa) and late-type (Sb, Sc, and Irr) galaxies, as expected from their different stellar populations. We also find that the colors of galaxies are correlated with their radial profiles, as measured by the concentration index and by the likelihoods of exponential and de Vaucouleurs' profile fits. While it is well known that late-type galaxies are bluer than early-type galaxies, this is the first detection of a local minimum in their color distribution. In all SDSS bands, the counts versus apparent magnitude relations for the two color types are significantly different and demonstrate that the fraction of blue galaxies increases toward the faint end.},

The data set contains 8370 galaxies with confirmed redshifts$\backslash$n in the range 0.7 ≤ z ≤ 1.4, over 1 deg 2 on the sky. Groups are identified using an algorithm (the$\backslash$n Voronoi-Delaunay method) that has been shown to accurately reproduce the statistics of groups in$\backslash$n simulated DEEP2-like samples. We optimize this algorithm for the DEEP2 survey by applying it to$\backslash$n realistic mock galaxy catalogs and assessing the results using a stringent set of criteria for$\backslash$n measuring group-finding success, which we develop and describe in detail here. We find in particular$\backslash$n that the group finder can successfully identify {\~{}}78{\%} of real groups and that {\~{}}79{\%} of the galaxies$\backslash$n that are true members of groups can be identified as such. Conversely, we estimate that {\~{}}55{\%} of the$\backslash$n groups we find can be definitively identified with real groups and that {\~{}}46{\%} of the galaxies we$\backslash$n place into groups are interloper field galaxies. Most importantly, we find that it is possible to$\backslash$n measure the distribution of groups in redshift and velocity dispersion, n ($\sigma$, z ), to an accuracy$\backslash$n limited by cosmic variance, for dispersions greater than 350 km s -1 . We anticipate that such$\backslash$n measurements will allow strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy$\backslash$n in the future. Finally, we present the first DEEP2 group catalog, which assigns 32{\%} of the galaxies$\backslash$n to 899 distinct groups with two or more members, 153 of which have velocity dispersions above 350 km$\backslash$n s -1 . We provide locations, redshifts and properties for this high-dispersion subsample.

abstract = {The cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons into halos typically is measured using some evolving virial relation, but recent work suggests that most halo growth at late cosmic time (z {\textless} 2) is not physical but is rather the by-product of an evolving virial radius ("pseudo-evolution"). Using Omega25, a suite of cosmological simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas dynamics with differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic accretion into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic accretion of both dark matter and baryons occurs at z {\textgreater} 1 across our halo mass range: M{\_}200m = 10{\^{}}{\{}11-14{\}} M{\_}sun. However, dark matter, because it is dissipationless, is deposited (in a time-average sense) at {\textgreater} R{\_}200m(z) in a shell-like manner, such that dark-matter mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at any radius within a halo at z {\textless} 1. In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate that roughly tracks the accretion rate at R{\_}200m, at all redshifts. Infalling gas starts to decouple from dark matter at {\~{}}2 R{\_}200m and continues to accrete to smaller radii until the onset of strong angular-momentum support at {\~{}} 0.1 R{\_}200m. Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject to pseudo-evolution, the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the accretion rate of gas on galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near R{\_}200m provides insight into the tight relations between the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host halos across cosmic time.},

abstract = {Galaxies that are several virial radii beyond groups/clusters show preferentially quiescent star formation rates. Using a galaxy group/cluster catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, together with a cosmological N-body simulation, we examine the origin of this environmental quenching beyond the virial radius. Accounting for the clustering of groups/clusters, we show that central galaxies show enhanced SFR quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyond groups/clusters, and we demonstrate that this extended environmental enhancement can be explained simply by 'ejected' satellite galaxies that orbit beyond their host halo's virial radius. We show that ejected satellites typically orbit for several Gyr beyond the virial radius before falling back in, and thus they compose up to 40{\%} of all central galaxies near groups/clusters. We show that a model in which ejected satellites experience the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can explain essentially all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching. Furthermore, ejected satellites (continue to) lose significant halo mass, an effect that is potentially observable via gravitational lensing. The SFRs/colors and stellar-to-halo masses of ejected satellites highlight the importance of environmental history and present challenges to models of galaxy occupation that ignore such history.},

abstract = {We identify galaxy groups and clusters in volume-limited samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. We optimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems that occupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created by populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for galaxy groups with 10 or more members: a group multiplicity function that is unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated halos; a spurious group fraction of less than {\~{}}1{\%} a halo completeness of more than {\~{}}97{\%} the correct projected size distribution as a function of multiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is {\~{}}20{\%} too low at all multiplicities. These results hold over a range of mock catalogs that use different input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. We apply our group-finding algorithm to the SDSS data and obtain three group and cluster catalogs for three volume-limited samples that cover 3495.1 deg2 on the sky, go out to redshifts of 0.1, 0.068, and 0.045, and contain 57,138, 37,820, and 18,895 galaxies, respectively. We correct for incompleteness caused by fiber collisions and survey edges and obtain measurements of the group multiplicity function, with errors calculated from realistic mock catalogs. These multiplicity function measurements provide a key constraint on the relation between galaxy populations and dark matter halos.},

abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFRs) and lie on the 'red sequence' than central ('field') galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster cat-alogues from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, together with a high-resolution, cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histo-ries and quenching time-scales of satellites of M star {\textgreater} 5 × 10 9 M at z ≈ 0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z ∼ 0.5, or ∼5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at M star {\textless} 10 10 M . We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2–4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of {\textless}0.8 Gyr. These quenching time-scales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in the satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experi-ence significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},
